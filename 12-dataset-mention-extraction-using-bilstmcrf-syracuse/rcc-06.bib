@article{singhalDataExtractMining2013,
	Abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of dataset extraction from research articles. With the growing digital data repositories and the demand of data centric research in data mining community, finding appropriate dataset for a research problem has become an essential step in scientific research. But given the wide variety of data usage in scientific research it is very difficult to figure out which datasets are most useful for a particular research topic. To alleviate this problem, an automated dataset search engine is a powerful tool. In this work we propose a novel approach to extract dataset names from research articles. We propose a novel way of using ``web intelligence'' from academic search engines and online dictionaries to mine dataset names from research articles. We also show a comparison between different sources of ``web knowledge'' by comparing different academic search engines such as Google scholar, Microsoft academic search. The performance of this approach is evaluated using standard information retrieval metric such as precision, recall and F-measure. We get an F-measure of 80\%. This accuracy is significant for an unsupervised approach.},

@article{ghavimiSemiautomaticApproachDetecting2017,
	Abstract = {Today, full-texts of scientific articles are often stored in different locations than the used datasets. Dataset registries aim at a closer integration by making datasets citable but authors typically refer to datasets using inconsistent abbreviations and heterogeneous metadata (e.g. title, publication year). It is thus hard to reproduce research results, to access datasets for further analysis, and to determine the impact of a dataset. Manually detecting references to datasets in scientific articles is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge in the underlying research domain. We propose and evaluate a semi-automatic three-step approach for finding explicit references to datasets in social sciences articles. We first extract pre-defined special features from dataset titles in the da|ra registry, then detect references to datasets using the extracted features, and finally match the references found with corresponding dataset titles. The approach does not require a corpus of articles (avoiding the cold start problem) and performs well on a test corpus. We achieved an F-measure of 0.84 for detecting references in full-texts and an F-measure of 0.83 for finding correct matches of detected references in the da|ra dataset registry.},

@inproceedings{luDatasetSearchEngine2012,
	Abstract = {A key step in validating a proposed idea or system is to evaluate over a suitable dataset. However, to this date there have been no useful tools for researchers to understand which datasets have been used for what purpose, or in what prior work. Instead, they have to manually browse through papers to find the suitable datasets and their corresponding URLs, which is laborious and inefficient. To better aid the dataset discovery process, and provide a better understanding of how and where datasets have been used, we propose a framework to effectively identify datasets within the scientific corpus. The key technical challenges are identification of datasets, and discovery of the association between a dataset and the URLs where they can be accessed. Based on this, we have built a user friendly web-based search interface for users to conveniently explore the dataset-paper relationships, and find relevant datasets and their properties.},

Authors typically make references to datasets by mentioning them for example by using their titles and the year of publication. However, in most cases explicit links that would provide readers with direct access to referenced datasets are missing. Manually detecting references to datasets in papers is time consuming and requires an expert in the domain of the paper. In order to make explicit all links to datasets in papers that have been published already, we suggest and evaluate a semi-automatic approach for finding references to datasets in social sciences papers. Our approach does not need a corpus of papers (no cold start problem) and it performs well on a small test corpus (gold standard).

@inproceedings{singhalLeveragingWebIntelligence2013,
	Abstract = {The problem of user's interest to item matching is at the core of recommendation systems and search engines. This problem is well studied in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with a recall of 90\% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art supervised classification approach. We get a significant improvement of 36\% using the proposed algorithm.},

@article{singhalResearchDatasetDiscovery2017,
	Abstract = {Y Abstract. Scientific datasets play a crucial role in data-driven research. While there are several repositories that curate public datasets, several more datasets and their usage is ``hidden'' in the research publications. Hence, discovering a relevant dataset P for a research topic requires in-depth investigation of several publications, tracking dataset usage and in-exhaustive literature search. To this end, a search engine to directly handle the research dataset discovery problem is extremely useful for the scienO tific community. In this work, we define an important paradigm of dataset search known as ``dataset discovery in application context''. Unlike dataset look-up type search where the user looks up for dataset in a repository, application context based search C corresponds to search without information about the name of the dataset. Such searches arise when the user is looking a best fit dataset for his research problem. We show that in this paradigm of search, conventional methods of indexing the little text about the dataset description do not work due to lack of application text content within the description text for a dataset. To alleviate this problem we propose two models of search, namely, (1) a user profile based search and (2) a keyword based search. We show R that in both these models the dataset discovery is done in the application context by leveraging information from open source web resources such as scholarly articles repositories and academic search engines. The performance of the proposed models were tested with simulated test queries (user profiles) as well as with real world user studies.},
