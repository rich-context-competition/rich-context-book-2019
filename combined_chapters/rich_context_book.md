# Chapter 1 - Introduction

Rich Context Introductory Chapter

Ian Mulvany, Paco Nathan, Sophie Rand, Julia Lane

Introduction
============

Science is at a crossroads. The enormous growth of access to data
coupled with rapid technological progress, has created opportunities to
conduct empirical research at a scale that would have been almost
unimaginable a generation or two ago. Researchers can now rapidly
acquire and develop massive, rich datasets; routinely fit complex
statistical models; and conduct their science in increasingly
fine-grained ways. Yet there is no automated way to search for and
discover what datasets are used in empirical research, leading to
fundamental irreproducibility of empirical science and threatening its
legitimacy and utility(*1*, *2*). There is an enormous interest to
change the current manual and ad-hoc system, and incentives are
increasingly aligned: while only a fraction of datasets are identified
in scientific research, those publications that do cite data are cited
up to 25% more than those that do not(*3*).

Vannevar Bush foreshadowed the issue more than 60 years ago:

> "There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased
> evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization
> extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions
> of thousands of other workers---conclusions which he cannot find time
> to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. ... Mendel's concept
> of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because
> his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and
> extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being
> repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in
> the mass of the inconsequential"(*11*).

We can do better -- and we now have the opportunity to do so.

The core problem that needs to be addressed is automating the search for
and discovery of datasets used in empirical data -- building an
Amazon.com for data. The vast majority of scientific data and outputs
cannot be easily discovered by other researchers even when nominally
deposited in the public domain. Faced with a never-ending stream of new
findings and datasets generated using different code and analytical
techniques, researchers cannot readily determine who has worked in an
area before, what methods were used, what was produced, and where those
products can be found. Resolving such uncertainties consumes an enormous
amount of time and energy for many social scientists. A new generation
of automated search tools could help researchers discover how data are
being used, in what research fields, with what methods, with what code
and with what findings ---often by passively capitalizing on the
accumulated labor of one's extended research community. And automation
can be used to reward researchers who validate the results and
contribute additional information about use, fields, methods, code, and
findings.(*8*)

New advances in technology---and particularly, in automation---can now
change the way in which social science, and hence other sciences, is
done. The place to start is with the social sciences. The great
challenges of our time are human in nature - terrorism, climate change,
the use of natural resources, and the nature of work - and require
robust science to understand the sources and consequences. The lack of
reproducibility and replicability evident in many fields(*1*, *4*--*7*)
is even more acute in the study of human behavior both because of the
difficulty of sharing confidential data and because of the lack of
scientific infrastructure. Social scientists have eagerly adopted new
technologies in virtually every area of social science research---from
literature searches to data storage to statistical analysis to
dissemination of results(*8*). And, in the United States, the recent
passage of the Foundations of Evidence-based Policymaking Act(*9*, *10*)
and the focus on a Federal Data Strategy, mean that there is an
important use case for showcasing the value of new approaches.

The knowing how it has been produced and used before: the required
elements what do the data ***measure***, what ***research*** has been
done by what ***researchers,*** with what ***code***, and with what
***results***. Acquiring that knowledge has historically been manual and
inadequate. The challenge is particularly acute in the case of
confidential data on human subjects, since it is impossible to provide
fully open access to the source files.

How this book came to be
========================

This book was born out of a need to solve a very concrete problem. In
2016, the US Congress passed the Commission on Evidence-based
Policymaking Act to make a set of recommendations on how to better use
data for decision-making. The US Census Bureau was charged with
supporting the deliberations of the Commission and asked our team at New
York University to build a secure access facility in which data from
multiple agencies could be securely hosted.

After we built the facility, and had dozens of users, we realized that
putting data in one place, while necessary, was not sufficient for good
analytical work to be done. Every user who accessed the data wanted to
know what other work had been done with the data, with what assumptions
and what results. We were able to provide them with some information,
but essentially the information was drawn from our own research
experience and was certainly not representative of the entire field. The
obvious solution was to see if computer scientists had the technological
tools available to automate the discovery of research datasets and the
associated research methods and fields in research publications. Our
computer science colleagues assured us that, while the technology
existed in principle, no single team was known for having developed a
solution.

We decided to see what we could to advance the field, and approached
Schmidt Sciences, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Overdeck Family
Foundation for support. As part of that support, we ran the competition
with the results described in this book. We challenged participants to
combine machine learning and natural language processing methods to
identify the datasets used in a corpus of social science publications
and infer both the scientific methods and fields used in the analysis
and the research fields.

The core of the book describes both how the competition was set up, as
well as the results achieved by different competing teams. However, as
is always the case with exciting research agendas, the competition
helped us identify five major scientific challenges that need to be
addressed: (i) document corpus development, (ii) ontology development
for dataset entity classification, (iii) natural language processing and
machine learning models for dataset entity extraction, (iv) graph models
for improving search and discovery, and (v) the use of the results to
engage the community to both validate the model results, retrain the
model and to contribute code and knowledge. So the other chapters in the
book provide an overview of what could be done with more resources and
talent devoted to this interesting question. The next section provides a
more detailed overview of the contribution of each chapter.

Book overview
=============

Section 1 provides an overview of the motivation and approach. Section 2
describes new approaches to develop corpora and ontologies. Section 3
describes the competition results in terms of model development. Section
4 provides a forward looking agenda.

Section 1: Motivation and approach

In Chapter 2, " Where's Waldo: Conceptual issues when characterizing
data in empirical research," researchers from the Research Data and
Service Center at the Deutsche Bundesbank show us why better metadata
for social science data enables discovery of datasets and research, in
ways that surpass what traditional metadata from data producers can
support. They present a new modus operandi in the service delivery model
of research data facilities, based on the premise that datasets have a
measurable value that can be deduced from the relationships between
datasets and publications, and the people who author, do research on,
and consume them - that is, Rich Context around datasets.

They argue that a major advantage of rich context is that it closes the
loop on metadata is closed: a loop initiated by the metadata from the
data producer side, is closed by metadata from the data usage side. The
authors elucidate why such rich data from the *usage* perspective is
needed to deliver codified knowledge to the research community to guide
literature review and new research; without understanding the linkage
between datasets and outcomes, we are disabled in shaping new, impactful
research.  

The authors identify two primary reasons for this need: first, that
metadata on the datasets from the data users perspective helps the data
creator to improve upon the quality of the data itself, improving
dataset owners' service delivery (e.g. bundesbank as a service provider,
the service being data provision, consulting on dataset usage, creation
of new data products, etc); and second, that metadata on the usage of
datasets in publications helps us measure impact of datasets in their
ability to drive policy-making. With this closed loop, the scope of
researchers' discovery is broadened to include not only literature and
datasets, but the interplay between those two - that is, how datasets
have been used by whom and how.   The authors discuss a tangible outcome
of measuring dataset value - a dataset recommendation system, enabling
expedient sharing of available datasets through the research community.

Chapter 3 outlines the operational approach that was taken to develop
the [Rich Context
Competition](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition).
The goal of the competition, the results of which are described in
Section 2, was to implement AI to automatically extract metadata from
research - identifying datasets in publications, authors and experts,
and methodologies used. As such, the competition was designed to engage
practitioners in AI and NLP to develop models based on a corpus
developed at the Interuniversity Consortium of Political and Social
Research. The competition attracted 20 teams from around the world and
resulted in four finalists presenting their results at NYU on February
15, 2019 (see the [agenda and video
here](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition/workshopagenda)).

The results of the competition provided metadata to describe links among
datasets used in social science research. In other words, the outcome of
the competition generated the basis for a moderately-sized knowledge
graph. the [winning
team](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/an-interview-with-the-allen-institute-for-artificial-intelligence)
in the Rich Context Competition was from [Allen
AI](https://allenai.org/) which is a leader in the field of using
embedded models for natural language. Typical open source frameworks
which are popular for deep learning research include
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (from Facebook) and the more recent
[Ray](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributed_training.html)
(from UC Berkeley RISElab).

Section 2:
===========

A major challenge is developing a training corpus that sufficiently
represents the population of all documents, and tagging the datasets in
the corpus. It is essential to do this well if high quality models are
to be developed. There is a literature outlining the issues with
developing a \"gold standard corpus\" (GSC) of language around data
being mentioned and used in analysis in academic publications, since
creating one is time-consuming and expensive (*12*) In Chapter 4
"Standardized Metadata, Full Text and Training/Evaluation for Extraction
Models", Sebastian tk and Alex Wade describe the need for, and
strategies for collecting, large sets of annotated full-text sources for
use as training data for supervised learning models developed in the
Rich Context Competition. Dataset Extraction, the NLP task at the core
of the Rich Context Competition, relies on a high-quality set of full
text sources with metadata annotations. Developing such a corpus must be
done strategically, as full-text articles and their metadata are
organized inconsistently across their sources. The corpora gathered for
use as training data for the Competition required ad-hoc manual labor to
compile. Here, authors describe the legal, technological and human
considerations in creating a corpus. They dictate the scale of full-text
data needed, and the impact that an interdisciplinary (e.g spanning
multiple domains) corpus has on that scale. They suggest development of
a corpus with open-access text resources, use of human-annotators for
labeling of full-text, and attention to the mix of domains that may be
in a corpus when developing models. 

There is a separate challenge of developing a common understanding of
what a dataset is. Developing standard ontologies is a fundamental
scientific problem, and one that is often in the domain of libraries and
information scientists. Although some measure of linguistic ambiguity is
likely to be unavoidable in the social sciences given the complex
subject matter, even modest ontologies that minimally control the
vocabulary researchers use would have important benefits. In Chapter 5,
"Metadata for Administrative and Social Science Data", Robert B. Allen
describes a framework for the application of metadata to datasets,
details existing metadata schema, and gives an overview of the
technology, infrastructure and human elements that need to be considered
when designing a rich metadata schema for describing social science
data. 

Allen describes three types of metadata - structural, administrative and
descriptive; and emphasizes the growth needed in descriptive metadata,
which are characterized by semantic descriptions. Allen describes
existing metadata schemas which accommodate domain-specific metadata
schema, like the W3C DCAT, and the unique semantic challenges faced by
social science as opposed to natural sciences - in particular that
concepts - e.g. "family", "crime" -  are less well-defined, and
definitions change across sub-domains. He considers data repositories
and describes the essential role of metadata in making such repositories
searchable and therefore useful. He touches on several prominent data
repositories in the social and natural sciences and describes their
methods of gathering metadata and how the metadata supports services
offered, like search, computing environments, preservation of data for
archives, and logging of the history of a dataset and its provenance.
Allen describes other challengings in creating and maintaining metadata,
prompted by things like changes in technology that yield data streams,
and changes in metadata standards. He discusses some of the technology
underlying data repositories; in particular data cubes for data storage
that facilitate data exploration and retrieval; containerization and
cloud computing enabling sharing and reproducibility; and collection
management systems which can provide metrics on usage, like number of
downloads, maintenance of datasets, etc. 

Section 3:
===========

Chapter 6, by the Allen AI team, describes their overarching approach.
The team used a named entity recognition model to predict dataset
mentions. For each mention, they generated a list of candidate datasets
from the knowledge base. They also developed a rule based extraction
system which searches for dataset mentions seen in the training set,
adding the corresponding dataset IDs in the training set annotations as
candidates. They then use a binary classiﬁer to

predict which of these candidates is a correct dataset extraction. While
this approach was eventually the winning approach given the design of
the corpus and the scoring mechanism, it suffers from being too fragile
for general application, since it is necessarily corpus dependent. That
team did not devote substantial time to identifying fields and methods.

Chapter 7, by the KAIST team, describes a very different approach. They
generated their own questions about dataset names and use a machine
learning technique to train the model for solving question answering
task. In other words, questions suitable for finding dataset names such
as "What is the dataset used in this paper?," are generated and the
question answering model is trained to find the answers to those
questions from the papers. Furthermore, the resulting answers from the
model are filtered by types of each word. For example, if an answer
contains words with organization or agency types, then this answer is
likely to include the actual dataset names. They also were quite
innovative with identifying research fields, by using Wikipedia as the
source, and methods by using machine learning techiques

Chapter 8, by the GESIS team, also used a Named Entity Recognition
procedure. However, their design was module-based approach and they
developed tools that can be used separately but also as parts of a data
processing pipeline. For identifying research methods and fields, they
exploited the Social Science Open Access Repository maintained at GESIS
-- Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. They also used the ACL
Anthology Reference Corpus which is a corpus of scholarly publications
about computational linguistics

Chapter 9, by the DICE team at Paderborn University, also used a Named
Entity Recognition approach. They trained an Entity Extraction model
based on Conditional Random Fields and combined it with the results from
a Simple Dataset Mention Search to detect datasets in an article. For
the identification of Fields and Methods, they essentially used search
string to find embedded words

Chapter 10, by Singapore Management University, was an incomplete
submission, with a very interesting approach. They used dataset
detection followed by implicit entity linking approach to tackle dataset
extraction task. They adopt weakly supervised classification for
research methods and fields identification tasks utilizing SAGE
Knowledge as an external source and as a proxy for weak labels.

Section 4: Looking forward
==========================

In Chapter 11, researchers from Digital Science describe the role user
engagement plays in creating rich context around datasets, which are
take on properties of 'first class research objects' (like journal
articles) in that they are published as distinct research outputs in
their own right.  Authors lay out a set of challenges in the sharing of
datasets and dissemination of dataset metadata, and articulate goals in
creating infrastructure to answer these challenges. 

As technology has yielded ever larger streams of datasets available for
social science research, two critical, interrelated elements of
infrastructure have not kept apace: information infrastructure, and
cultural infrastructure.  Information infrastructure refers to content
of interest to the rich context competition models - journal articles,
datasets, and their metadata (including details on the data stewards,
usage of the datasets in research, and code used to prepare and analyze
datasets). Cultural infrastructure refers to the incentives and value
propositions in place to encourage individual data stewards, data users
and experts to share datasets and contribute metadata on datasets.
Cultural infrastructure around datasets do not fit into the existent
culture of research publications. 

In venturing to build out information infrastructure around datasets, we
must consider how concepts like versioning, reproducibility, and peer
review carry over to datasets. Further, how do metadata carry over, when
there is so much variability in what we mean when we say dataset?
Incentives around data sharing, dataset curation, and metadata
contribution are even slimmer than in publishing, where there exists a
culture of "publish or perish." This question must be resolved if we
wish to enrich the context around datasets to make them more efficiently
consumable. 

The future agenda is described in the concluding chapter by Paco Nathan
and Ian Mulvany

The first step is to create a corpus of research publications to be used
for training data during the Rich Context Competition.

The next step will be a formal implementation of the knowledge graph,
based primarily on extensions of open standards and use of open source
software. That graph is represented as an extension of a DCAT-compliant
data catalog. Immediate goals are to augment search and discovery in
social science research, plus additional use cases that help improve the
knowledge graph and augment research.

In the longer term, the process introduces human-in-the-loop AI into
data curation, ultimately to reward researchers and data stewards whose
work contributes additional information into the system. With this
latter step, in the broader sense Rich Context helps establish a
community focused on contributing code plus knowledge into the research
process

General competition information

The competition had two phases. In the first phase, participants were
provided with labeled data, consisting of a corpus of 2,500 publications
matched to the datasets cited within them. Participants could use this
data to train and tune their algorithms. In the second phase, they were
provided with a large corpus of unlabeled documents and asked to
identify the datasets used in the documents in a test corpus, as well as
the associated methods and research fields. The participants were scored
on the accuracy of their techniques, the quality of their documentation
and code, and the efficiency of the algorithm -- and also on their
ability to find methods and research fields in the associated passage
retrieval.

### Abstract

Empirical economic and social science research uses microdata for analyses to connect theory to socie-tal problems. We present conceptual lessons learned from a machine learning competition held to au-tomate the discovery of datasets, research methods and fields in these research publications. Obtained information from the competition can be used to inform the debate about the added value of the used (micro) data. Being able to measure societal benefits of data access is important to put funding decisions on an objective basis, since much research data is generated by publically funded researchers or available from official institutions. The obtained information from the competition can also be used to build up a user-centric dataset recommendation system. Both of these outcomes will elevate the current knowledge generating process of empirical research in a research data centre.

### Introduction

Policy makers increasingly recognize that informed decision-making requires microdata-backing. Only microdata can uncover interdependencies between entities and document disparate global develop-ments. Making microdata available for independent research is subject to legal requirements that are designed to prevent the disclosure of information concerning an individual person or business entity. At Deutsche Bundesbank, the Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) is tasked with making microdata available for independent research while simultaneously ensuring statistical confidentiality.

To strengthen effective quantitative research through optimal microdata usage, the RDSC has engaged in a series of projects that are targeted at enhancing user experience. One specific project currently pur-sued by the RDSC is the development of a microdata recommendation system, which is based on how microdata is being used in empirical research. Describing microdata from the usage in publications dis-tinguished this approach from traditional metadata for researchers, which is largely based on how data is produced.

Empirical research papers are an obvious source of information about dataset usage. A useful microdata recommendation system needs to rely on a corpus of dataset usage, as large as possible. Hand-curating such a sufficiently large corpus is prohibitively labor-intensive and error-prone. Therefore, being able to automatically retrieve the necessary information from research papers lays the groundwork for any future implantation of such a recommendation system. The competition is an important first step and proofs data set extraction from research publications to be feasible and scalable.

We present lessons learned from the machine learning competition held to automate the discovery of datasets, associated research methods and fields in social science research publications. In doing so, we show our insights about dataset taxonomies from our experience in a research data center and from designing a machine learning competition. We do this with a background of all authors in social science.
We refer the readers interested in the more technical aspect of the task of extracting dataset citations from publications to later chapters.

Extracting dataset citations from publications is a fairly difficult task because of the variety of dataset ci-tation formats and the absence of training data. Besides empirical research support, the gained infor-mation is the basis to provide value for policy purposes in the G20 context. For example, by providing researchers with information about the use and availability of microdata previously not being available in a systematic way, the results of this competition and the ensuing microdata recommendation system are a step towards reducing data gaps that have been diagnosed in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

On a broader level, the outcome of the competition contributes to the ongoing digitalization efforts of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Extracting relevant information from research papers as an unstructured data source broadens the value of unstructured, underexplored, data. Thus, the project presents a well-defined use-case to turn tacit knowledge into codified knowledge by converting text into relatively well-structured information. As a concrete first institutional implementation of competition results, microdata-based research will be supported by turning unstructured information into a useful source of reference for researchers.

### Insights from a research data centre perspective

#### Background

The overriding principle of Bundesbank – and other Central Banks, National Statistical Institutes and Of-ficial International Institutions - when working with micro data is compliance with the statutory secrecy and data protection requirements, and thus maintaining the confidentiality of the information submitted by the reporting agents. European and national legal provisions regulate both the user group and the access channels to micro data, prescribe the required degree of data anonymisation and oblige data providers and data recipients to maintain data confidentiality at all times.

In response to the increased internal and external demand for microdata and the data confidentiality re-quirements, in 2013 the Bundesbank set up the Integrated Microdata - based Information and Analysis System (IMIDIAS) and established the Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) (for a detailed moti-vation, refer to Kalckreuth, 2014 and Bender and Staab, 2015). The RDSC applies a standardised pro-cedure to generate high-quality datasets that cover a large part of data requests for research purposes. Thereby, the RDSC grants internal and external researchers’ access to selected Bundesbank microdata and serves as an interface between data producers and data users.

Requests to use microdata are first reviewed pursuant to legal requirements. The RDSC provides access to anonymized datasets on banks, securities, investment funds, enterprises and households, all of which can be accessed at dedicated researcher workstations or for most of the Bundesbank’s surveys – as for the Panel on Household Finances (PHF) study – the RDSC offers so called scientific use files. Data access and the underlying legal requirements are described in detail by Schönberg (2018).

In addition, the RDSC provides information and advice to researchers on data selection, data content and analytical approaches. Together with the relevant statistical experts, it ensures that the microdata provided are documented in detail and archived. In doing so, the RDSC works according to globally rec-ognized standards and was accredited as a research data centre (RDC) by the German Data Forum (“Rat für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsdaten”).

To date, metadata in the RDSC is provided to research using structured data reports. They are an es-tablished and well-functioning tool to convey information linearly from the data producers via the RDSC to the data users. To go a step further, efforts are underway in the RDSC to document microdata from the usage side. This relevant source of information has not been considered yet, because necessary in-formation on which datasets are used in which publication has not been broadly available to date. The competition changes this for the first time.

Potential of such data documentation from the usage side is manifold. Examples include newly arriving researchers, who get to see, what other researchers did with the data. At a glance, one can directly see potential for linkages with other micro datasets if others have done it. Data producers benefit from feed-backs on potential data gaps or limitations of the used data (which goes back to the initial institutional motivation for creating a research data center). Thereby a circular information flow is created by allowing feedback loops.

A main principle of the RDSC is to give free access to Bundesbank micro data for independent research. Motives for doing so are to get feedback on the data (use published research results to increase the internal data knowledge) and to strengthen evidence-based policy-making by Bundesbank itself. For fulfilling both of these tasks, the RDSC has to ensure microdata is used effectively by providing excellent services. Implementing potential for structured feedback from researchers back to data production and new research enables an improving empirical knowledge generating process.

#### The knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC

The knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC can be organised along the four key dimensions (i) data services, (ii) research, (iii) publication, and (iv) (structured) user specific knowledge.

 ![](./combined_images/20190614_Figure1.jpg)

Figure 1: The four dimensions of the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC

Data Services comprises raw microdata and comprehensive documentation of the data both of which the RDSC compiles together with the data producing units  in Bundesbank. [^footnote1] Furthermore, the data ser-vices dimension also includes the methodological improvement of microdata through e.g. applying rec-ord linkage techniques to facilitate the creation of new datasets for research. Finally, the RDSC also of-fers advisory services to potential and existing microdata users on topics such as e.g. dataset selection or analytical options.

[^footnote1]: Data producers in different departments across Bundesbank compile, e.g. microdata, indicators, or time series.

The second dimension of the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC is re-search. After the application of a researcher is approved by the RDSC, researchers conduct their re-search project in a secure environment designed to ensure ongoing compliance with internal data policies and external government regulations. For most microdata this requires researchers to be physically present at the premises of the RDSC in order to analyse the data. Furthermore, only strictly anonymised research outcomes may be used outside of the secure environment.

Researchers as users of data services produce research outcomes. These outcomes – after data confi-dentiality clearance – sometimes take the form of publications, which present results to the interested public in a form optimized for human consumption as unstructured text. These publications contain knowledge accumulated by researchers about data usage over time (experience), e.g., knowledge about dataset particularities, which in turn could be utilised to inform the debate on how to improve data services

Examples of user specific knowledge acquired by researchers include:
•	How data is used (e.g. additional data cleaning, variable transformation, combining datasets, us-ing additional information)
•	What purposes data is used for (e.g. topics, methodology, research area)
•	What kinds of analyses or techniques have been tried and are used ultimately
•	What information about data is most valuable to get to the results, respectively which linkage or data enrichment makes renders the data most valuable.

Being able to access structured user-specific knowledge through e.g. a competition enables improving data services by making discovery of data and related projects, people, and publications at Bundesbank more comprehensive and efficient. For example, knowledge harvested from publications may be used to enhance services provided by RDSC by allowing standard datasets to be tailored to the needs of re-searchers. Similarly, data producers benefit from feedback on their data, allowing them to improve data quality.

The challenge is to establish such a feedback loop. If effective feedback is given and used, the microda-ta-based knowledge-generating process restarts with data services, but on a higher level. Better data services in turn allow better research, because available microdata is better described and more effec-tively used. By automatizing the feedback-loop between research, publications, knowledge, and data services, the knowledge generating process can loop faster and augment quicker. We expect this to lead to improvements in the four key dimensions of this process of empirical research in the RDSC.

  ![](./combined_images/20190614_Figure2.jpg)

Figure 2: Elevating the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC to a higher level by enabling a feedback loop to data services.

At the moment, this feedback loop is not present in a systematic way. The aim of the competition is to identify appropriate procedures to close the gap between publication and data services, which would enable transforming knowledge available in publications into generally re-usable knowledge to inform stakeholders (data producers, RDSC, decision makers at Bundesbank). The results of the competition will thus ultimately enable better data services which in turn will make research outcomes more efficient through the channel of a more optimal data usage.

#### Added value of structured user-specific knowledge

This section details two applications of obtaining dataset usage information from publications that would add value to the data services provided for the RDSC. First, existing applications can be optimized in a user-centric way which would lead to obtaining refined products (e.g. improved researcher recommen-dations and data documentation). Second, the case for societal investment in free data access can be empirically fortified. Positive externalities (i.e. research as a public good) suggests a less then societally optimal provision of research data and related services. Obtaining a dataset impact factor can then make the case for further investment in microdata provision by concretely showing a dataset’s impact.

The structured user-specific knowledge produced during the competition may be used to inform the de-sign of a dataset proposition system for researchers. By obtaining information on dataset usage in publi-cations, data is for the first time available to construct indices on data set joint usability (and dataset maps to visualize such indices). Such an index connects datasets through actual use by researchers that combined data sets in the past. This enables recommendations, such as, “Researchers, who used dataset A, also used dataset B”.

Going further, the usability index can be expanded into a measure, how well new datasets fit each other. Without needing joint dataset usage in past publications goodness-of-fit measures may be predicted based on dataset usage in the same field, using the same methods or by additional metadata similarity. This can be a valuable accelerator to effectively distribute new datasets in the research community. While both indices can be implemented using only information from the competition, extensions may enhance value to users which are based on other information such as current metadata.

When thinking about user recommendations, the example is set by large online platforms. These online platforms can recommend from two dimensions of information (excluding interaction for simplicity). First, data is available on a large number of observed purchases per customer, which enables statements like “since you like products A and B, you might also like C”. Second, data is present on large numbers of observed customers per product, which enables statements like “users like you also bought”.

In our setting, with the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC, we consider researchers and datasets. The universe of data users/ researchers is decently large (i.e. the first dimen-sion), but per user, we only observe a limited amount of “dataset consumption” (i.e. the second dimen-sion). Hence, we have a decent chance of recommending based on other users behaviour. However, we have only limited means of predicting a single users future datasets needs based on his past personal “dataset shopping” behaviour.

However, we suspect a simpler underlying behavioural model of “data shopping” compared to shopping through large online platforms, because publishing with one dataset is not a casual purchase. Instead, it implies real commitment relating to being content with the purchase (less cognitive dissonance). Thus, we suspect that, compared to online platforms, less data points per person are needed, in order to make sensible recommendations. Also, in order to gain more of the rare information per user, we can fall back on dataset citations, i.e. “indirect data usage”, as outlined in chapter 3.

A challenge in building a data-driven recommendation system is to make sure that recommended da-tasets are indeed feasible to use, i.e. constitute meaningful recommendations. Thus, besides information about datasets, additional information such as fields and methods is needed to be ingested into the system. This additional information essentially constitutes additional links between datasets that helps better align datasets. This is especially true in the finance domain where linking microdata is a common feature in empirical research.

Second, the RDSC as part of a public institution has a responsibility towards its principals i.e. society. Granting data access free of charge for researchers should be backed by empirically measurable bene-fits of such data provision. Benefits from data usage can justify societal investment in free data access. However, measuring societal benefits through data access is not obvious at first glance. One possible starting point of approximating societal benefits of data access can be to measure the creation of knowledge [^footnote2] created by specific datasets.

[^footnote2]: In our model, we have called this knowledge user specific knowledge. Here the knowledge is in that sense specific, that it can be used to fulfil the task of Bundesbank in a better way

One can argue that added value of providing administrative microdata is the marginal benefit relative to the second-best comparable commercial database, if such a database exists. Also, one can argue that a dataset, which enables causal evidence, adds more value to societal knowledge, compared to previously available datasets, from which only correlations could be deduced if an important goal is to inform the policy debate. However, both of these methods require identifying which empirical result from a publica-tion can be attributed to which dataset.

### Lessons learned from competition

#### Related literature

Extracting dataset citations from publications is a fairly difficult task because of the variety of dataset ci-tation formats and the absence of training data (for a recent overview of data retrieval see Koesten et al., 2019). Boland et al (2012) propose a weakly supervised approach, using a pattern induction method for the detection of study references in full texts. They use a corpus of 259 publications from the Social Science Open Access Repository (SSOAR). They use a bootstrapping approach, starting with a small corpus of manually created training instances. The resulting system InfoLink now informs SSOAR.

Boland and Mathiak (2015) describe dataset extraction as a twofold task, finding dataset citation string and following entity resolution (match the string to the correct entity/ DOI). Concerning entity resolution, they report the difficulty of broad survey dataset citations that ignore data variability (such as years, ver-sions, questionnaire variants, etc.), motivating a dataset taxonomy. Named dataset citations are often underspecified allowing identification of the survey but not of the precise dataset (which of multiple sub-samples, aggregation levels, survey modes, etc.).

Zhang et al (2016) also use a bootstrapping approach to extract dataset citations from 116 computer science journals publications. Ghavimi et al. (2016) use a similar approach for social science papers finding datasets with well-documented metadata. According to them, only 25% of all dataset citations are given in the references, highlighting the unstructured citation culture for datasets. We advance from these with an environment with less available dataset metadata and a corpus of publications from a va-riety of fields for our purposes. To tackle this, we continue with a larger hand-curated annotated corpus.

Metadata schemas for datasets are available, such as DataCite metadata schema and the da|ra metadata schema, which complies with the DataCite schema (Helbig et al. 2014). They offer dataset taxonomies and standardized citation propositions, however their categories do not optimally support automatic search and extraction, if no unique dataset identification (such as a DOI) is used. In the con-text of central banks that provide microdata, recent progress has been made in the context of INEXDA. A metadata standard (in line with DataCite) has been developed (Bender et al. 2018) and datasets pro-vided by the RDSC are all DOI registered.

Improving dataset citation is high on the scientific agenda in recent years. This notably includes promot-ing widespread usage of persistent and unique dataset identifiers. As available datasets spread across a large number of databases, identification of datasets is important for reproducibility and to credit data creation efforts to incentivize data creation and publication (Lagoze and Vilhuber 2017, McMurry et al. 2017, Mooney and Newton 2012). If unique and persistent dataset identification in publications were available, Ball and Duke (2011) raise the idea of dataset impact factors with such information.

#### Dataset mentions

This section presents lessons that we learned throughout the duration of the competition. We organise this section around the three sets of information that where the main focus of the competition: datasets mentions, research fields, and (statistical) methods used. We begin by describing our a priori expectation of what a dataset is. We did not delve into definitions of a dataset but rather considered it sufficiently defined for our purposes (as empirical social scientists and for the competition).

Since our approach depends on getting to know the user-perspective, we thought it plausible to let usage in empirical papers define a dataset for the purpose of the competition. Having a background in working at a large provider of financial data, we had a vague idea that all datasets would look like those the RDSC provides access to, which consist mostly of collections of structured data in matrix or database form. These datasets typically are defined by a name and with a well-defined scope, thus allowing clear citation, probably including a unique dataset identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier, DOI).

##### Lesson #1: datasets fall into two broad categories

Since the corpus of publication used for the competition spanned different domains (like healthcare, ed-ucation, and others), we quickly realized that our dataset image had an econocentric bias. In social sci-ence, we learned, datasets can be categorized into two broad categories for the purposes of extraction. First, there are named datasets, i.e. well defined, usually large-scale and publicized datasets (e.g. Com-pustat).

Generally, named dataset mentions are short strings in the publications, have commonly used abbrevia-tions (e.g. MMSR), and often containing institution name or name of commercial data vendor. Some-times (rarely, but increasingly) these datasets can be identified by a unique digital object identifier (DOI). These datasets are usually well-defined in scope and time, with formal documentation available. While data is usually collected with a specific purpose in mind, such datasets are be used across multiple pa-pers and research domains.

The second dataset category is what we call created datasets. By created dataset we understand da-tasets usually collected or built by authors of a publication for the purpose of analysing one specific re-search question. Often, created data comes in the form of small-scale surveys, (structured) interviews, or randomized controlled trials, RCTs. Such data normally does not have a trademark name, but instead one or multiple paragraph descriptions in the publication. Dataset information is blended together with information on data collection and sampling methods. Data reference at its most condensed form then comes in a structure like “we interview a given number of participants in a given region suffering from a given disease and code responses in the following way”.

In contrast to named datasets, created datasets usually are not referred to by a specific string or com-monly used abbreviation. Data collection is usually paper specific, and the universe of existing datasets are not easily searchable. This makes it hard for text mining algorithms to correctly extract strings refer-ring to dataset entities. Specific created datasets are harder to use for follow-up research, and reproduc-ibility is given only if publishers provide data together with the paper. Therefore, the lack of unique iden-tification and search terms renders data collection potentially redundant and dataset spread not optimal.

##### Lesson #2: Fractions of dataset category are domain specific

Throughout the competition duration it became clear that the fraction of named and created datasets varies across social science domains. Since different fields of social sciences rely on different identifica-tion techniques and differing potentials for conducting RCTs, the predominantly used data sources natu-rally vary. This has important repercussions for designing a competition, since algorithm performance and later recommendation system performance varies with the input corpus and the application field.

The number of datasets used per empirical paper (linked data) also varies across research areas. This number is also dependent on named vs. created datasets. In fields with widespread use of multiple da-tasets at once, the added value of recommending additional useful data might be expected to be higher than in fields that create study-specific data every time. Conversely, one could argue that the marginal utility of adding additional datasets is decreasing.

The optimal way forward is to start a data recommendation system for research field with higher ex-pected marginal utility from additional datasets. In our view, these are research areas with widespread usage of named datasets. Named datasets are constructed without the concrete research question in mind. That is why information to answer a particular research question often has to be obtained from more than one data source and is particularly true in empirical economic and finance research.

##### Lesson #3: Unique identification of datasets remains an issue

From the distinction above, one could make the argument that named datasets are easier to identify than created datasets. However, this is not the case, because the same dataset name can refer to multiple subsamples or waves of same datasets, and it is unclear where to make distinctions between dataset entities. This makes it difficult to identify the mentions referring to the same data points. Issues are, just to name a few, different time periods or subsamples, different states of data and states of knowledge, computational data pre-processing or enrichment steps. These identification issues render the current task of entity resolution of extracted dataset mentions complicated.

Unique dataset identification carries significant repercussions for reproducibility purposes, where identi-fying the exact data used for a study is paramount. For reproducibility purposes, the current solution to this dataset identification problem is the direct data upload to the publisher together with the publication. This is neither storage-efficient for large datasets nor feasible in the case of confidential microdata. A more flexible way to solve this issue is to assign unique identifiers (DOIs) to the datasets.

With a DOI (identifying the exact time frame, sampling universe, data version, wave, aggregations, state of knowledge, etc.), datasets are identified and quantitative research using confidential microdata is re-producible. To make lives easier, DOIs also drastically facilitate the automatized extraction of well-defined datasets from publications (comparable to largely standardized citations of other publications, allowing easy retrieval of publication networks, etc.).

Summarizing, if we successfully identify datasets and solve the issue of entity resolution, we can link and propose created datasets and thereby enable further research with such data, which takes up a notable fraction of publications in certain fields. While this task is harder than for named datasets, the potential for improvement remains larger as of today. For created datasets, too, DOI usage would be desirable; however encouragement or enforcement to use DOIs is harder in this case, because of a larger target group – authors instead of a limited number of data stewards. Even in case of widespread DOI usage for named datasets, the competition algorithms yield valuable results through the created datasets extraction in order to allow referencing and making available datasets used in the past for further analysis.

##### Lesson #4: Datasets mentions could indicate used for analysis vs. cited

After a discussion about dataset types and usage in fields, the last lesson that we learned about datasets concerns the mention of datasets in publications. These mentions come in two types. First, datasets used for empirical analysis and second, cited datasets in the literature review or references. Dataset citations (without empirical usage) can generally occur in the literature review section, even in theoretical, methodological papers, e.g. a given paper might report summary statistics based on datasets (“Author Y uses Compustat to…”). Sometimes differences between cited and used datasets are only semantic in nature. In well-written papers, the difference is usually fairly easy to distinguish for humans, but less clear for algorithms.

A key lesson we learned, is to think ahead of time, what the informational need is for the use-case at hand, used or cited datasets. Note that in an optimal setting, if information were available on the universe of datasets used for analysis in papers and on all publication citations, dataset citations would be redundant. This comes from the fact that a dataset citation in one publication is based on a dataset used for analysis in another publication and can be linked via available literature citations.

While literature citations are mostly standardized within research domains and are relatively straightfor-ward to extract (hence publication networks / publications maps exist), information on used datasets in papers remains incomplete (even after the competition). Because of this, for the competition, we asked for used and cited datasets. It is important to note, that extracted dataset citations are always incomplete, since some authors report aggregate statistics from a different paper, but not the data behind (“Smith et al show…”).

If well separated, through extracted dataset citations, one obtains a “dataset map”, thus the “closeness of datasets”, and network measures such as centrality distinguishing important datasets (“nodes”). Through extracted empirical dataset usage on the other hand, one obtains relevant information for our purposes, namely information relating to dataset similarity and joint usage possibilities from the user perspective. However, for our envisioned recommendation system, usage of cited data (“indirect” data usage) is a valuable feature, since it yields more limited data on dataset “purchases” of a user.

As training data for the algorithms it is important to include theoretical literature, essays, etc. in the corpus of publications. Obviously, this is helpful for algorithms to correctly identify true negatives, i.e. correctly identifying theoretical papers. For this task, distinguishing between cited and used datasets becomes relevant once again, because clearly separating theoretical papers that merely cite data from empirical papers depend on such a distinction.

#### Fields and Methods

The competition also asked participants to extract information about research fields and methods used in the publication. We want to gather this information from the user side, because data producers and annotators do not necessarily foresee all usage potential for their data and the point of our envisioned system is to increase user value. One such idea is to construct dataset similarity indices from the usage side, information is relevant not only on existing joint usage by others (“people like you often used dataset Y, too” – hence dataset extraction), but also on new dataset or linkage potentials (“this might also interest you based on your preferences”). For this, information is necessary on the context, how datasets are used.

##### Lesson #5: Think before you act: define fields and methods

To obtain the most relevant categories of research fields, we did not provide any thesauri to the compe-tition, on purpose. The rationale behind this was to see the unhindered creativity of teams, which availa-ble information sources they would use or not use (e.g. reference datasets, Wikipedia, archive.org, other repositories, thesauri, statistical clustering techniques, etc.). On the other hand, thesauri limit the cata-logue of potentially identifiable fields and methods, thus prohibiting new methods and fields to be identi-fied in fast-changing modern research areas. Also thesauri might disturb algorithm performance, since algorithm might be forced to categorize topics and fields to older or less exact categories than necessary.

However, using thesauri does have well-known advantages, as any librarian will confirm. These ad-vantages include easy clustering of similar fields and methods and a manageable category set of predic-tions. For field predictions, we generally face a fine line between too broad predictions (safe, but unin-formative) and too narrow predictions (narrow, but potentially wrong). A potential way out is backward induction here – we can present differently aggregated predictions for fields to users and get feedback from them (let users rank usability – “Was this helpful to you?”).

Concerning our definition of methods for the purpose of the competition, two questions arise. The first is the definition of statistical methods (i.e. inclusion of sampling methods, qualitative methods, etc.). Sec-ondly, there are multiple statistical methods in a publication (besides the main causal analysis, there can be methods reported for data preparation, sampling, baseline results, robustness checks, descriptive statistics, etc.) and issues of potential weighting of importance of these.

For useful new recommendations to be provided to researchers, we decide to include in statistical methods all methods that describe potential for a merge of datasets / joint usability, hence to include all the above listed. We consider a broad definition of methods, not only including high-level statistical methods, such as ordinary least squares, but also including the observed unit, time period or even re-gression equations. If two papers then use different datasets in the same field using the same methods, there is a relatively high likelihood that those datasets can be linked or used together to create new in-sights.

#### Discussion

Several decades ago, publication citation networks were constructed and to our knowledge no such un-dertaking has yet been done for datasets. This comes from the fact that no curated training data corpus is readily available in decent quality. Since no such data is available, we manually annotate papers for the competition and now propose to go forward with this in a larger scale.

We would have no need for this competition in a world with universal dataset identifier usage (such as DOIs). In such a scenario unique identification and standardized citations of datasets would be readily available. Since DOIs only now and slowly gain widespread application for datasets in social science, our task is a 1:n mapping of publications to datasets without unique identifiers. For scientific papers many journals already provide DOIs for papers.

There are ongoing efforts by journals to have all used data published for reproducibility reasons. Incen-tivizing researchers to provide unique identification of datasets used in papers is a logical next step. This will ensure reproducibility for confidential microdata and facilitate our use-cases. In the meantime, we show a way forward to learn from the current state of information and analytically use presently available information.

The competition highlights that datasets can be categorized in different dimensions for the purposes of extracting dataset mentions from publications. We propose a binary distinction of datasets into named as opposed to created datasets. As named datasets, we consider formal, large datasets by commercial or official institutions, often referenced in relatively standardized forms as commonly used abbreviations. Created datasets are those created for the specific purpose of one research question in mind. They are generally described in less standardized paragraphs. Usage of named versus created datasets varies across research areas.

Also varying across research areas is the number of datasets used per empirical paper. This number al-so depends on the spread of formal, named datasets as opposed to created datasets for single studies. In fields with widespread use of multiple datasets at once (linked data), the added value of recommending additional useful data might be expected to be higher than in fields that create study-specific data every time. Conversely, one could argue that the marginal utility of adding additional datasets is decreasing. The optimal way forward is to start a data recommendation system for research field with higher expected marginal utility from additional datasets.

### Conclusions

In this competition, we asked teams to extract datasets, fields and methods from a corpus of hand-annotated research publications. The value of the extracted information lies in informing a user-centric dataset recommendation system and thereby enabling optimal and timely spread of available datasets throughout the research community. Furthermore, such information allows us to compute dataset impact factors by obtaining data-driven information on which datasets underlie high-quality research outputs. This in turn is a proxy for societal benefits of data provision by research data centres, thus motivating in-vestment in data access infrastructure.

We introduce a circular model of the knowledge generating process, which increases in levels. From da-ta services, research is conducted, publications are published and user-specific knowledge is generated. Having such knowledge on dataset usage, data services in turn can be improved. Thereby the circle repeats on a higher level. The current competition works on strengthening the knowledge pillar as well as the transmission mechanisms from publications to knowledge to improved data services. [^Footnote3]

[^Footnote3]: For the future, ongoing effort is needed to support all four “corners of the circle” / “pillars of the level model”. The current competition strengthens the arrow from publication to knowledge and structures gained knowledge to improve data services. To support the data services pillar – for example -, digital RDC environments with facilitated access processes like a “data stewardship module” will in our view improve data access.

Automatic processing of generated knowledge in publications becomes increasingly available with mod-ern text analysis tools. Extracting such information is important, because timely and optimal usage of gained results increases the speed, by which findings can be incorporated into data services and thereby next-level research is enabled in turn. To further improve automatic processing, minimum standards for dataset taxonomy are needed. Harmonized metadata schemas for data sets – like the INEXDA metadata schema for central banks and statistical offices (compliant with and building upon DataCite) – offer such an approach.

The competition showcased that information extraction of the necessary information for such systems is possible. The delivered prototype algorithms prove this claim. With the proof of concept, there is a more substantiated case for investing in a larger hand-curated training corpus of annotated research papers. On the road towards a user-centric dataset recommendation and metadata system, the competition forced us to clarify organizational needs and methodological aspects.

For the way forward, it is important to note the importance of the research area on the strategic path to-wards a unified user-centric microdata recommendation system. The choice of the research domain will greatly influence algorithm performance. Since human effort in creating training data is expensive, one should deliberately pick research domains to start with. This arises because text extraction algorithms (and humans) struggle with informally described created datasets. The low-hanging fruits of prototyping dataset recommendation systems, usability indices etc. are easier to implement for research areas with a largely formalized dataset citation culture (however ultimately potential for benefits may well be larger in other research areas).

3.1 Introduction
----------------

The relationship between research, researchers and data is changing.
Data has always played a critical role in scientific research, however
in recent years it has taken centre stage not only for the so-called
hard sciences, but also for the social sciences, and it has an
increasing role in the humanities (Giuliano, 2019). We assert that this
change is, at least in part, driven by two key factors: First, the
increasing volume of data that is available to researchers either, for
example, through the increasing sensitivity of instruments that aid
experimental work, or through the ubiquity of computer systems with
which we interact in our daily lives. Second, our ability to process and
analyse these data is growing quickly as computers become faster and
algorithms become more powerful. While some researchers welcome having
more data to work with, others are challenged or marginalised in this
new data-rich world (Eijnatten et al., 2013; Grusin, 2014; Leurs and
Shepherd, 2017). These effects are often compounded by the tools that
researchers must master to connect their research to data.

In the hard sciences, the CERN Open Data Portal contains 131 datasets
describing particle collisions, each of which comprise around 300Gb of
data at the time of writing (CERN, 2019). In the social sciences, the
CISER Data Archive at Cornell is home to more than 1000 different social
science data sets (CISER, 2019). These examples are individual instances
chosen at random from many that could be used to demonstrate the variety
and scale of data available for research. However, even these examples
don't begin to quantify the amount of detailed personal data available
to companies such as Facebook. Data of this latter kind has already been
used in academic studies as well as in more controversial contexts
(Jordan and Weller, 2018; Kamp et al., 2019; Stark, 2018). Clearly,
there is an increasing diversity and depth of data available for
research from both traditional and from new sources.

Many researchers now work with large volumes of data. Fortunately, many
facilitating technologies have become commoditised and are available at
a fraction of their original cost: storage is cheap and data transfer is
fast. But, Increasing the value of data to researchers is no longer
about technology, rather it is about the information and culture around
the data.

In this chapter, we take our lead from Chapter 1 in recognising not only
that science is at a crossroads but that the whole of research is
changing. We discuss two elements of infrastructure that, if enhanced,
can make data more useful and valuable to the whole research community:
information infrastructure and cultural infrastructure. The Rich Context
project supports the development of tools that enrich not only
information infrastructure around datasets, but which also enhance the
cultural infrastructure. *Information infrastructure* includes details
of the approach to data stewardship, context of usage, code applied to
the dataset in its production, as well as code applied to the data to
derive further results or translate it for practical uses. All these
factors add critical elements to the research infrastructure. *Cultural
infrastructure* includes creating the incentives, triggers and
frameworks that encourage the dataset stewards, experts and users to
contribute to these critical information elements.

3.2 Information Infrastructure
------------------------------

Information infrastructure can be defined as the collection of processes
and artefacts that are foundational to today's scholarly communications.
A simplified model of scholarly communications would have artefacts such
as journals, journal articles, article metadata and citations. In this
case, the processes would be peer review and scholarly search.

When creating one of the first scientific journals *Philosophical
Transactions* 350 years ago, the members of the Royal Society did not
have today's data-centric world in mind. While a clear line can be drawn
from the articles of that time to the articles of today, infrastructures
have grown up around research publications in the intervening years that
have moved the structures and expectations of the research article
forward. These norms are powerful and persistent through their ubiquity.
For example, in the large majority of modern research literature, we
continue expect articles to be grouped into journals and published on a
specific date, and we expect there to be a version of record that
constitutes a definitive record of a piece of research.

Data is more fluid than a standard research article: it is produced and
updated more frequently and iteratively; it needs to be shared with many
in a collaborative context; it is processed and versioned by different
colleagues. Data does not fit into the normalised research publication.
Research fields that rely on data are beginning to publish data as a
distinct output from a research article. Data is becoming a principal
research output, while the technological challenges of publishing data
are being addressed, the format and necessary fields of the metadata
that describe data, the file format in which the data resides, the
resource to annotate the data to make it useful to others, the way in
which data should be cited in a paper or by another dataset, the
description of the processing that has been applied to the data, the
details of the ethical review process behind the exercise that gathered
the data, and many other norms do not yet exist homogeneously across
subjects and geographies. There are not yet strongly established norms
that help researchers to have trust in data.

A dataset can change with time for many reasons: data may be added over
time, corrections may be issued, and so on. In these cases, it may be
appropriate to "version" the dataset (by issuing a persistent identifier
for a point-in-time snapshot for the dataset, allowing subsequent
changes to receive their own "versions"). But changes to a dataset may
have a knock-on effect on the interpretation of the data and may
fundamentally alter the research result that was originally reported.
Moreover, in many fields "Big Data" is so central that it not only puts
pressure on the community to establish an acceptable model of data
publication, but also puts significant stress on how we read, interpret,
and review research as a whole.

Many datasets are now so vast that we lack the ability as humans to
consume them in an easy way. Visualisation technologies and other tools
that allow us to interact with and sample data dynamically have received
significant attention in recent years, and have helped with the
interpretation of data in online environments. But it is simply
impossible to reduce some types of data to a single figure or printable
table, as would be the case for "traditional" journal publishing. By
attempting to do so, we miss the essence of the data and risk failing to
communicate data-driven conclusions accurately. This limitation of
current publication formats (e.g. static PDF files for articles) is an
issue that relates to the reproducibility crisis of modern research.

Peer review is another process that is not easy to apply to data as a
"first class" research object. Historically, peer reviewers have ensured
that a piece of research is well-communicated and correct in the sense
that it is reproducible. This level of peer review is difficult to apply
in the context of research data. If data is being published as a primary
output, then it may be possible to perform a kind of peer review by
applying some statistical tests to a sample of the data, or by using
some other appropriate technique. However, it is no longer practical in
most cases to set up a parallel experiment to reproduce data, as had
been the case in years past. Across all contexts there are good reasons
for these challenges: the experiment may be too costly to repeat, or the
conditions of the original data collection may not be replicable (for
example, surveying stress levels of the populace during a specific
political event). In addition, ethical considerations such as the
anonymity of those being surveyed may make certain types of data
difficult to review. Thus, we need to develop robust and accepted
approaches to peer review, not only for data itself but also for those
publications that are heavily based on data. Without peer review or some
suitable proxy for peer review that makes sense for data, it is
difficult to know whether a dataset can be trusted. Without trust, a
dataset has no value to a researcher who seeks to build upon it.

Several publishing innovations have made journal articles more
discoverable and accessible in recent years, such as preprint servers,
the widespread use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), and centralized
search engines. However, while some of these infrastructures do enhance
a researcher's ability to find research data, they do not fully
translate from the realm of journals to data. There are multiple reasons
for this lack of translation, some of the key features include: a)
weakness of a homogeneous metadata infrastructure for datasets; b)
inhomogeneity in the types of data that can be shared; c) proliferation
of different platforms to store data; d) lack of standardised
publication practices; e) lack of adoption of standards across fields.
When compared with the "shape" of an academic article for which there is
a standard structure (e.g. DOI, abstract, title, authors, keywords, etc)
specifically designed to facilitate human search, it is clear that
datasets are contextualised by an immature information infrastructure.

Datasets are more complex to classify and annotate than articles, yet
some progress is being made. The core fields required to create a valid
DataCite record are identifier, creator, title, publisher, publication
year and resource type (DataCite Metadata Working Group, 2016). All
other data fields are optional (e.g. location, funder, subject,
contributors) due to the fundamental uncertainty in what might
constitute research data in the future. This flexibility limits how data
can be discovered. It has taken some years for Web of Science, Google
and others to introduce functionality to search for datasets in their
discovery systems.

Technological infrastructure for data\--or lack thereof\--has huge
implications for the discovery, peer review, citation practices,
interpretation, and availability of data. These challenges are
interconnected with challenges we face when thinking about the cultural
infrastructure for data, as well.

3.3 Cultural Infrastructure
---------------------------

There are two main aspects to cultural infrastructure: incentives and
capability. Both aspects affect how researchers engage with research
data, and their behaviours relating to sharing it with others and making
it available to external scrutiny.

Anecdotally, academics do not typically take up research careers for
financial gain. Rather, they choose to dedicate themselves to
understanding a specific problem or field partially in the hope of
making a discovery. For most researchers, success is not strongly
coupled to prize winning, but rather by winning the freedom to determine
their own research agenda. Researchers in many fields are promoted by
publishing in specific high-impact journals, leading to funding success,
which in turn usually leads to greater control of your research.

Sharing data is often not well-aligned with the current model of
incentives. Parting with the data that underpins your research gives
rise to two concerns. Firstly, that someone may find an error in your
work and discredit what you have done. Secondly, that someone else may
not share their own data but will gladly reuse yours if you make it
available. This is especially the case in fields where success is based
on having more data to analyse.

A further level of inequity exists in which data-related jobs are valued
by the Academy. If a researcher happens to be particularly talented in
working with data curation, data analysis or data processing, there is
no track for recognising these talents. They are unlikely to be a first
author on a publication in a major journal due to their data wrangling
talents, and hence they have less of a chance of career progression than
researchers who take a more traditional "publish or perish" path with
their work as described above.

This set of perverse incentives means that people with the capability to
handle data are often incentivised to leave research. Hence, not only do
we have a problem of incentives in sharing and communicating data, but
we also have a problem in retaining people who have the capability that
we need to structure data so that it can be shared and built upon.

Capability for sharing data is the second aspect of the cultural
challenge that academia continues to wrestle with. Making data available
to others is generally accepted as a key part of the research
communication process. However, there are certain established norms
around when the data should be shared, and to what depth it is shared
(Linek et al., 2017); for example, in fields where human subjects
research is prevalent, there is a much more conservative attitude
towards open data than in fields like astronomy where data sharing is
widely practiced, given that data can be collected by only a handful of
observatories and telescopes worldwide.

In fields that are more applied, ensuring that data generated as a
result of a commercial relationship is protected is crucial. In such
fields, academics often have a better understanding of copyright,
intellectual property rights and licences (Treadway et al., 2016). But
outside of this context, there is a general lack of understanding of
these issues and hence data are often not shared over concerns for a
perceived legal barrier.

Other concerns are ethical---for example, should these data be shared if
it might infringe the rights of the subjects of the research?
Researchers are beginning to become aware that, through the use of
algorithms, some data is not as well anonymised as it may first appear
(Siddle, 2014). Anonymisation of data is a research field in and of
itself (Li et al., 2007).

The degree and nature of ethical issues and industry-proximity vary
greatly between different research fields and give rise to different
cultures of data usage and re-usage across fields and even within
fields. Some researchers are motivated to engage with the open access
community and hence choose approaches to sharing data that include
granting permissive licences, association of unique identifiers with
data, adherence to data standards and training students to adhere to
similar approaches. Other researchers are motivated to ensure that data
are not shared due to the information that can be inferred by processing
the data.

The power of the newest algorithms, or of algorithms yet to come, mixed
with constantly developing ethical nuance means that it is difficult to
pre-empt what may or may not be acceptable to share in the future.
Hence, some may feel that it is simply better not to share, especially
in the social sciences, where many of these issues are more prone.

Other concerns are simply practical---how does one make data available
in a way that is meaningful to others? The work associated with making a
dataset generically machine-readable is challenging for many
researchers, who are not to be experts in data handling. The work
associated with making a dataset human-understandable, reproducible and
fully contextualised is often significant. Funding constraints may make
it impractical to share data or to add useful, valuable or even critical
annotations to a dataset. However, funders are beginning to prioritise
these activities in their grant programs (Jisc, 2019; NNLM, 2019). All
these factors lead to uncertainty exacerbated by different levels of
confidence and understanding and consequently an uneven landscape in
what is shared, how it is shared and where it is shared.

 3.4 Enriching context
---------------------

The points discussed above offer some indication of what would be needed
to improve the value of research data. Firstly, to address issues of
cultural infrastructure, we need to adopt an expanded version CredIT
(Allen et al., 2014) that focuses on datasets. This expansion would
ensure that all contributors to a dataset's creation, development and
maintenance over time are stored in a machine-readable format. Such a
record is central to the facilitation of culture change across research.
Only with this structure in place can the activities around datasets be
readily recognised and incentives created that would support data
sharing. Secondly, to address the deficits in information
infrastructure, a set of tools that allow research data to be discovered
and contextualised needs to be introduced. In this section, we focus on
this second challenge.

The ability to add context any piece of research was a strong driver for
the creation of Dimensions (Hook et al., 2018). The idea that all
research happens in a particular place, at a particular time, carried
out by a set of people, some of whom may be affiliated with a research
institution, gives a set of metadata that allows us the "weak context"
of a piece of research. By "weak context" we mean that the context being
provided gives no deep understanding of the context of an article to a
non-expert and is essentially indistinguishable from standard metadata.
But with modern data mining approaches, it is possible to add a "strong
context".

Strong contextualisation of research should provide a user with rich
information about the research including funding, other research
produced as part of the larger project (e.g. related publications,
clinical trials, etc), and details of the research that was built on top
of it. This information should also fit into, trends and graphical
representations that offer a more complete, more rapid understanding of
how research fits into the larger field, related fields, or the context
of the publishing journal or supporting institution. For example, for a
research article, we should be able to quickly understand how many
researchers are in a related field, whether the field is growing, how
old the field is, how much funding has been deployed in the field, which
countries have provided that funding, whether the field has begun the
translation to application through patents or clinical trials, or
whether it has been used as a basis for the formulation of policy.

Context can also be offered in the data that we provide to understand
the reach and influence of research.

Alternative metrics ("altmetrics") are data from the social web that run
orthogonal to classic citation measures, which can be seen to add
significant context to an article -- extending our understanding of how
different cohorts of potential users of the research are engaging with
it. For example, altmetrics can be used to understand if an article is
being mentioned in the news, in which geographical regions it is being
noticed, whether it is being used as part of a teaching syllabus, and
many other kinds of public and non-traditional scholarly engagement.
These data can then be visualized in creative ways to add instant
additional context to engagement with a research article (see Fig. 3.1).

height="2.5277777777777777in"}

research output.

How datasets are used in research more broadly is another important
piece of context that data search engines lack that would significantly
enhance discoverability of a dataset and that would consequently
increase the value of the data. This is where the Rich Context project
can add significant value to a broad research community.

Enhanced context for research data and its impacts could be offered to
users in the form of in-app badges and other "signposts" that connect
data with its larger context. Such a contextualizing badge could bring
together existing data, including not only the number of citations that
the dataset has received, but also whether the data has been versioned
(through Figshare's repository metadata), discussed online (through
Altmetric data), and what kind of tools and insights have been built on
top of the data (through rich mining of full-text and citation data
available in the ReadCube reference management corpus and in
Dimensions).

Correctly developed and accepted by the community, this type of
information can make a contribution to solving many of the problems
highlighted in this article. If the correct contextual facets can be
developed, then recognition would be easier to assign to those who have
contributed to the process of creating and maintaining datasets. With
greater context around them, datasets become easier to locate,
understand and value. This in turn could lead to a broader evaluative
environment and more engagement from academics.

Engagement across academia, however, is not uniform. Mechanisms need to
be provided to engage data science-focused researchers from whom more
details of their tools, scripts and codebooks could be drawn, adding
further value to research data. At the same time, engagement tools need
to allow data scientists to leverage this information so that it is
valuable to them when they are the consumers of search results. These
are subtly different use cases from those of standard researchers. By
mining ever more open research systems wherein data is being analyzed
(e.g. Gigantum, Github, etc), we can start to integrate these other
crucial engagement contexts as well.

*Figure 3.3: Mock-up of a research data badge helping to contextualise a
specific dataset.*

In Figures 3.2 and 3.3, we have visualised some early concepts for how a
contextualized research data badge could look. This visualisation is
based on insights from the Rich Context project and uses data that could
be mined from articles that use a specific dataset. In particular, we
suggest four facets of context that both data science-focused
researchers and others could find helpful when viewing a dataset:

-   **Experts** **who have made use of the data**, sourced from
    references made to the dataset in a professional context such as an
    industry whitepaper or policy document

-   **Academics** that **cite the data**, mined from citation of the
    dataset or ancillary data in the peer reviewed literature

-   **End users of the data**, sourced from code book references
    included in public code repositories

-   **Enhancements of the data**, vis-à-vis annotations and comments
    made on the data in public forums.

In summary, we believe that, if deployed across the many environments in
which researchers discover data, the thinking behind the Rich Context
project can overcome both the cultural and information-based
infrastructure challenges that we highlighted. If these challenges can
be overcome by the methods developed, for example in Chapter 13 of this
volume, then this will significantly extend the use and discoverability
of datasets. The number and variety of datasets in use in academia will
certainly expand in the future, and we can only see data becoming even
more central to contemporary research efforts. As such, it is critical
to invest in robust infrastructures, not only to support the production
and sharing of these data, but also to change the culture and evaluative
environment around research data. It is only through initiatives such as
these that we will be able to solve the vast and complex sociotechnical
challenges that face academia today.

[Introduction](#sec:intro)
============

The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) is a non-profit
research institute founded by Paul G. Allen with the goal of advancing
artificial intelligence research for the common good. One of the major
undertakings at AI2 is to develop an equitable, unbiased software
platform Semantic Scholar<sup>1</sup> for finding relevant information in the
scientific literature. Semantic Scholar extracts meaningful structures
in a paper (e.g., images, entities, relationships) and links them to
other artifacts when possible (e.g., knowledge bases, GitHub
repositories), hence our interest in the rich context competition (RCC).
In particular, we participated in the RCC in order to explore methods
for extracting and linking datasets used in papers. At the time of this
writing, Semantic Scholar comprehensively covers the computer science
and biomedical literature, and we plan to expand our coverage in 2019 to
other scientific areas, including social sciences.

In the following sections, we describe our approach to the three tasks
of the RCC competition, which are described in more detail in Chapter 5:
1. extracting the datasets used in publications,
2. predicting the field of research of publications
3. extracting the methods used in publications

[Methods](#sec:methods)
=======

[Dataset Extraction and Linking](#sec:datasets_methods)
------------------------------

This task focuses on identifying datasets used in a scientific paper.
Datasets which are merely mentioned but not used in the research paper
are not of interest. This task has two sub-tasks:

1.  Citation prediction: extraction and linking to a provided knowledge
    base of *known datasets*, and

2.  Mention prediction: extraction of both *known and unknown* dataset
    mentions.

### Provided Data ###

The provided knowledge base of known datasets includes approximately 10K
datasets used in social science research. The high textual similarity between
different datasets in the knowledge base informs our approach for linking dataset
mentions to their dataset in the knowledge base. Approximately 10% of the datasets in the
knowledge base were linked one or more times in the provided corpus of
5K papers. To attempt to generalize mention discovery beyond those present in the knowledge base, we train a named entity recognition (NER) model on the noisy annotations provided by the labeled mentions in the knowledge base.

![image](combined_images/datasets.png)
Figure 6.1: A high-level overview of our appraoch to dataset mention detection and linking.

We provide a high-level overview of our approach in Figure
6.1. First, we use an NER
 model to predict dataset mentions. For each mention, we generate a
list of candidate datasets from the knowledge base. We also developed a
rule based extraction system which searches for dataset mentions seen in
the training set, adding the corresponding dataset IDs in the training
set annotations as candidates. We then use a binary classifier to
predict which of these candidates is a correct dataset extraction.

Next, we describe each of the sub-components in more detail.

### Mention and Candidate Generation ###

We first constructed a set of rule based candidate citations by exact
string matching mentions and dataset names from the provided knowledge
base. We found this to have high recall and low precision, both on the provided development fold
and our own development fold that we created. High recall and low precision was the desired outcome for this candidate generation step. However, after our test
submission, it became clear that there were many datasets in the actual
test set that did not have mentions in the provided knowledge base. If the provided development fold had been representative of the test set (rather than the train set) in terms of what datasets were mentioned in it, we could have discovered this issue sooner. In this case, it would have been more representative of the test set if it included more datasets that did not have example mentions in the provided knowledge base. The importance of reliable evaluation and training data is discussed further in Chapter 12.

To address this limitation, we developed an NER model to predict
additional dataset mentions. For NER, we use a bi-LSTM model with a CRF
decoding layer, similar to Peters et al., 2018, and implemented using
the AllenNLP framework<sup>2</sup>. In order to train the NER model, we
automatically generate mention labels by string matching mentions in the
provided annotations against the full text of a paper. This results in
noisy labeled data, because it was not possible to find all correct
mentions this way (e.g., some dataset mentions were not annotated), and
the same string can appear multiple times in the paper, while only some
are correct examples of dataset usage.

We limit the percentage of negative examples (i.e., sentences with no
mentions) used in training to 50%, and use 40 words as the maximum
sentence length. We use 50-dimensional Glove word embeddings
(Pennington et al., 2014), 16-dimensional character embeddings with 64
CNN filters of sizes (2, 3, 4). The CNN character encoder outputs
128-dimensional vectors. We optimize model parameters using ADAM
(Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 0.001. Training the model took approximately 12 hours on a single GPU.

In order to generate linking candidates for the NER mentions, we score
each candidate dataset based on TF-IDF weighted token overlap between the mention
text and the dataset title. For a given mention, many dataset titles can
have a non-zero overlap score, so we take the top 30 scoring candidates
for each mention as the linking candidates for that mention.

### Candidate Linking ###

The linking model takes as input a dataset mention, its context, and one
of the candidate datasets in the knowledge base, and outputs a binary
label. We use a gradient boosted trees classifier using the XGBoost<sup>3</sup>
implementation. The model takes as input the following features:

* prior probability of entity, estimated based on number of occurrences in the training set (float between 0 and 1)
* prior probability of entity given mention, estimated based on number of occurrences in the training set (float between 0 and 1)
* prior probability of mention given entity, estimated based on number of occurrences in the training set (float between 0 and 1)
* whether the same year appears both in the mention context and in the dataset title (binary)
* mention length (int)
* mention sentence length (int)
* whether the mention is an acronym, computed by checking if it is one token that is all upper case (binary)
* estimated section title of the mention, computed by searching backwards from the mention for the nearest section header (binary one-hot)
* count of overlapping words between the mention context and dataset keywords provided in the knowledge base (int)

We note that it is possible to predict zero, one or multiple dataset IDs for the same mention, and each dataset candidate is scored independently.

We performed a randomized hyperparameter search with 100 iterations over the following hyperparameters and ranges and used a learning rate of 10^-1:

* `max_depth` : `range(2, 8)`
* `n_estimators` : `range(1, 50)`
* `colsample_by_tree` : `numpy.linspace(0.1, 0.5, 5)`
* `min_child_weight` : `range(5, 11)`

Each model took a negligible amount of time to train, and the entire hyperparameter search took a few minutes to train on a machine with 8 CPUs.

[Research Area Prediction](#sec:areas_methods)
------------------------

### Data ###

The second task of the competition is to predict research areas of a
paper. The task does not specify the set of research areas of interest,
nor is training data provided for the task. After manual inspection of a
subset of the papers in the provided test set, the SAGE taxonomy of
research, and the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) (Shen et al., 2018), we
decided to use a subset of the fields of study in MAG as labels. In
particular, we included all fields related to social science or papers
from the provided training corpus. However, since the abstract and full
text of papers are not provided in MAG, we only use the paper titles for
training our model. The training data we ended up with included
approximately 75K paper titles along with their fields of study as
specified in two levels of the MAG hierarchy. We held out about 10% of
the titles for development data. The coarse level (L0) has 7 fields
while the more granular one (L1) has 32. Fields associated with less
than 100 papers were excluded.

### Methods ###

For each level, we trained a bi-directional LSTM which reads the paper
title and predicts one of the fields in this level. We additionally
incorporate ELMo embeddings (Peters et al., 2018) to improve performance.
In the final submission, we always predict the most likely field from
the L0 classifier, and only report the most likely field from the L1
classifier if its prediction exceeds a score of 0.4. It takes approximately 1.5
and 3.5 hours for the L0 and L1 classifiers to converge, respectively.

[Research Method Extraction](#sec:methods_methods)
--------------------------

### Data ###

The third task in the competition is to extract the scientific methods
used in the research paper. Since no training data was provided, we
started by inspecting a subset of the provided papers to get a better
understanding of what kind of methods are used in social science and how
they are referred to within papers. This limitation, and the difficulty of working on an undefined task, is discussed in Chapter 2.

### Methods ###

Based on the inspection, we designed regular expressions which capture
common contextual patterns as well as the list of provided SAGE methods.
In order to score candidates, we used a background corpus to estimate
the salience of candidate methods in a paper. Two additional strategies
were attempted but proved unsuccessful: a weakly-supervised model for
named entity recognition, and using open information extraction (openIE)
to further generalize the list of candidate methods.

[Results](#sec:results)
============

[Dataset Extraction and Linking](#sec:datasets_results)
------------------------------

First, we report the results of our NER model in Table
6.1. Since it is easy for the model to memorize
the dataset mentions seen at training time, we created disjoint train,
development, and test sets based on the paper--dataset annotations
provided for the competition. In particular, we sort datasets by the
number of papers they appear in, then process one dataset at a time. For
each dataset, we choose one of the train, development, or test splits at
random and add the dataset to it, along with all papers which mention that dataset. When there is a
conflict, (e.g., a paper *p* has already been added to the
train split when processing an earlier dataset *d<sub>1</sub>*, but it is
also associated with a later dataset *d<sub>2</sub>*), the later dataset
*d<sub>2</sub>* along with all papers associated with it are added to the
same split as *d<sub>1</sub>*. For any further conflicts, we prefer to
put papers in the development split over the train split, and the test
split over the development split.

We also experimented with adding ELMo embeddings (Peters et al., 2018),
but it significantly slowed down training and decoding which would have
disqualified our submission due to the runtime requirements of the
competition. As a result, we decided not to include ELMo embeddings in
our final model. If the requirements for the competition had permitted the use of a GPU at evaluation time, neural network based embeddings like ELMo could be leveraged.

prediction on the phase 1 and phase 2 holdout sets. Note that the
phase 1 holdout results are for citation prediction, while the phase 2 holdout results are for mention prediction.


We report the end-to-end performance of our approach (on the development
set provided by the organizers in the first phase) in Table
6.2. This is the performance after using the
linking classifier to predict which candidate mention--dataset pairs are
correct extractions. We note that the development set provided in phase
1 ended up having significantly more overlap with the training data than
the actual test set did. As a result, the numbers reported in Table
6.2 are not indicative of test set performance.
End to end performance from our phase 2 submission can be seen in Table
6.3. This performance is reflective of our
focus on the linking component of this task. Aside from the competition
development set, we also used a random portion of the training set as an
additional development set. The initial model only uses a dataset
frequency feature, which gives a baseline performance of 38.4 F1. Adding
p(d $\mid$ m) and p(m $\mid$ d), which are the probability of entity
given mention and probability of mention given entity improves the
performance ($\Delta = 2.3$ F1). Year matching helps disambiguate
between different datasets in the same series, which was found to be a
major source of errors in earlier models ($\Delta = 2.8$ F1).
Aggregating mentions for a given dataset, adding mention and sentence
length features, adding an is acronym feature, and further
hyper-parameter tuning improve the results ($\Delta = 12.5$ F1). Adding
examples in the development set while training the model results in
further improvements ($\Delta = 2.8$ F1). Finally, adding the NER-based
mentions significantly improves recall at the cost of lower precision,
with a positive net effect on F1 score ($\Delta = 0.7$ F1).

Two clear limitations of our model are its difficulty in generalizing to unseen datasets, and its inability to effectively distinguish between datasets that are used in a publication and datasets that are merely referenced. These limitations are the main causes of the low recall (due to difficulty generalizing to unseen datasets) and low precision (due to difficulty distinguishing between used datasets and referenced datasets). An interesting approach to improving recall is presented in Chapter 7, and could potentially be leveraged in future work.

[Research Area Prediction](#sec:areas_results)
------------------------

To select a model, we performed a 100 trial random search across model
hyper-parameters, evaluated on a held out development set of papers from
the Microsoft Academic Graph. Our final model contained 512 hidden
dimensions, 2 layers and 0.5 dropout prior to classification. The top
performing classifier achieved 84.4% accuracy on our development set on
L0 fields, and 65.2% accuracy on our development set on L1 fields. The main limitation of using MAG for this problem is that our model cannot find new fields of research, and is limited to those provided by MAG. Additionally, our method performs classification based only on the titles of papers, while there are other pieces of information about the paper that would be useful for classifying the field of research. Other resources that could have been used to help with this task are presented in Chapters 7 and 8.

[Research Method Extraction](#sec:methods_results)
--------------------------

We evaluated performance by manually evaluating the output of our
extractor for a subset of 50 papers from the provided test set to
compute precision. Since evaluating recall requires a careful
annotation, we resorted to using yield as an alternative metric. Our
final submission for method extraction has 95% precision and yield of
1.5 methods per paper on the manually inspected subset of papers. Similarly to research area prediction, the main limiation here is the difficulty our model has finding new methods, as it is limited to the SAGE ontology and a few hand-crafted patterns. One potential way to alleviate this issue is to leverage external resources, as presented in Chapter 8.

[Conclusion](#sec:conclusion)
==========

This report summarizes the AI2 submission at the RCC competition. We
identify dataset mentions by combining the predictions of an NER model
and a rule-based system, use TF-IDF to identify candidates for a given
mention, and use a gradient boosted trees classifier to predict a binary
label for each candidate mention--dataset pair. To identify research
fields of a paper, we train two multi-class classifiers, one for each of
the top two levels in the MAG hierarchy for fields of study. Finally, to extract research methods, we
use a rule-based system utilizing a dictionary and common patterns,
followed by a scoring function which takes into account the prominence
of a candidate in foreground and background corpora.

We now provide some possible directions of improvement for each
component of our submission. For dataset extraction, the most promising
avenue of improvement is to improve the NER model, and the most
promising avenue to improve the NER model is to collect less noisy data.
We effectively have distantly supervised training data for the NER
model, and the first thing to try would be directly annotating papers
with dataset mentions to provide a clearer signal for the NER model. As mentioned previously and discussed in Chapters 5 and 8, the dataset mentions provided are not located in the text, and are simply extracted strings. Given these strings, labels in the actual text can be created by searching for the provided string. However, this is a noisy process, as the string may occur multiple times in the document, and all occurrences may or may not be correct dataset mentions. This is especially problematic when the string is a common word (e.g. "time"). Therefore, directly annotating the strings in the full text (i.e. providing character offsets for the strings) would help to reduce the noise in the NER data. For
research area prediction, it would help to include signals beyond just
the paper title for predicting the field of study. The difficulty here
is finding labeled training data that includes richer signals like
abstract text and paper keywords. For method prediction, exploring
the use of open information extraction is a potential avenue
of future research. Additionally, it would be helpful to clarify what
exactly is meant by a method, as it is currently unclear what a
successful method extraction looks like.
The main lesson learned is that, when presented with noisy, distantly supervised, real-world data, to produce a production-quality system, it becomes very important to (1) have a high-confidence evaluation dataset, and (2) look for other data sources that are similar enough to the task at hand to be useful. Taking steps towards both of these objectives are promising avenues of future work.

As discussed in Chapter 1 and throughout, the dataset extraction discussed in this report is intended to be part of a broader effort to create infrastructure and tools that will aid in the discovery and usage of datasets in social science research. This is critical to enable reproduciblity, collaboration, and effective use of data. We look forward to seeing what comes out of this project as a whole, and how AI techniques can be leveraged to have positive impact in the social sciences.

title: 'Finding datasets in publications: The KAIST approach. Text Mining Using Question Answering'
---

Non-technical Overview
=============
The KAIST’s approach for retrieving datasets is to generate questions about datasets like *what is the dataset used in this publication?* and use a machine-learning system that can read a publication and a question, and give the answer to it. This machine-learning system retrieves a list of candidate answers among which one of them should be the name of the dataset. To remove those wrong candidate answers, they proposed to filter them out by their entity types. For example, if the entity type of a candidate answer is *organization*, it is likely to be a dataset name because datasets are created by organizations.

For research field retrieval, they proposed to compare publications with Wikipedia articles to discover the research fields. First, they crawled Wikipedia articles that correspond to the list of research fields. Then, they retrieved the research fields of the publications by measuring the similarity between the papers and the crawled Wikipedia documents. For example, they crawled the Wikipedia article *economic history* which corresponds to the research field *economic history*. If the similarity between a publication and the article *economic history* is high enough, it is determined that the publication belongs to the research field *economic history*. They proposed to use TF-IDF as similarity measure, which is based on term frequency and document frequency, but others could be applied too.

For the research methods retrieval, they modeled the task as a named-entity recognition problem. They considered research methods as named entities, real-world objects that can be denoted with a proper name, and trained a machine learning model to identify and retrieve them.

Literature Review
=============

Although *Information Retrieval* is a well-established research field, only a few attempts have focused on the task of dataset extraction form publications. [@ghavimi2016identifying] tackled this problem using heuristics and dictionaries but encountered several problems. Firstly, they gave too much weight to acronyms. For example, *NYPD (New York Police Department)* is detected as a dataset name.
Secondly, they gave too much weight to the year of publication of the datasets because they assumed that dataset names are usually followed by the year of publication. However, this may only apply to Social Sciences publications. For example, Computer Science datasets do not appear followed by the publication year so this heuristic cannot detect all possible types of dataset mentions.

What did you do
=============

In this section, a detailed explanation of the used models for dataset names, research field, and research methods retrieval is provided.

Datasets Retrieval
------------------

The followed approach to retrieve dataset names is based on Machine Reading Question Answering (MRQA). First, given a publication, a list of candidate paragraphs in which the dataset is mentioned is selected. Then, using a query generation module, a specific query for each paragraph is created. After that, each pair of paragraph-query is input into the MRQA model. This model creates a list of candidate answers that is further processed using a feed-forward neural network. This network takes as input pairs of candidate answers and their entity types. The types of the answer candidates are obtained using an entity typing module. The output of this feed-forward neural network is the final list of dataset names found in the publication. Figure 7.1 shows an overview of the pipelined system. In the following subsections, the MRQA, query generation, and entity typing models are explained in detail.

![image](combined_images/OverallModel.png)

*Figure 7.1: Overall architecture for dataset retrieval*

### Document QA

MRQA models are neural networks that find answers for given queries according to a text. These answers must appear explicitly in the text. Since the dataset retrieval task is about finding explicit dataset mentions from publications, MRQA models are suitable for this task.

The MRQA model used in this work is Document QA [@clark2017simple]. It uses Bi-GRU, bi-attention, and self-attention mechanism. In addition, Document QA performs a paragraph selection that pre-filters and selects the *k* most relevant paragraphs using TF-IDF similarity between the query and paragraphs of the text. The model was trained on SQuAD v1.1, a common dataset to train MRQA models [@rajpurkar2016squad]. For details about the implementation and computing resources to train it, they refer to the original publication.

The KAIST team had the hypothesis that MRQA models do not need the full publication to find datasets. Rather, the MRQA models only need to process the paragraph where the answer appears. Among the literature of MRQA, the model used in this work stands out because of its paragraph selection stage. Using this model, it is possible to select a list of candidate paragraphs where the answer may appear, and then use the MRQA model to process them and retrieve the datasets.


### Query Generation Module

Queries that are suitable for finding datasets are required to utilize an MRQA model for the dataset retrieval task. However, defining a general query for retrieving datasets is not trivial, since the dataset mentions appear in various forms like surveys, datasets, or studies. Therefore, they devised a query generation module to generate multiple specific queries instead of a single general query.

To create a list of important query terms that the queries should include, they used a query generation model proposed by [@yuan2017machine] that creates a query given a text and an answer. All the queries generated by this model are too specific and cannot be used for other publications or other dataset names. However, they can be utilized to create a list of query terms to generate more specific queries for other publications. To create this list, they extracted query terms that are frequent in the list of queries and at the same time are not frequent in sentences that do not include a mention to a dataset. Because of this, these query terms have the discriminative power to retrieve dataset mentions since 1) queries are generated to extract mentions and 2) the query terms do not appear in the sentences without dataset mentions.
This list is used two times in their pipelined system. First, concatenating the first *k* query terms a general query is built. This query is employed by the paragraph selection stage of Document QA, as shown in Figure 7.1. Then, the query generation module generates specific queries for each paragraph concatenating the query terms that appear in the paragraph and on the list.

### Entity Typing Model

Ultra-Fine Entity Typing [@Choi:2018:ACL] can predict a set of free-from phrases like *criminal* or *skyscraper* given a sentence with an entity mention. For example, in the sentence: *Bob robbed John and he was arrested shortly afterward*, Bob is of type *criminal*. In the task of the present book, candidate answers proposed by the MRQA model and the sentence in which they appear are input into Ultra-Fine Entity Typing. This system can predict 10k different entity types among which *dataset* is included. However, after a few experiments, they observed that most of the entity types obtained from the dataset names are not *dataset* but *organization*, *agency*, and similar types. This is due to the fact that datasets are usually created by organizations and thus, they include the name of the organization in the name of the dataset. Since these entity types are consistent, it is possible to use them as a feature for their candidate answer classifier. In this work, the KAIST team used the pre-trained model that was released with the original publication. For details about the implementation and computing resources to train it, they refer to the original publication.

### Candidate Answer Classifier

Using the score given by the MRQA model for each candidate answer and the entity types given by the Entity Typing model for each candidate answer, a neural network classifier that filters the wrong candidate answers provided by the MRQA model is used. The intuition of this classifier is that a candidate answer with a high score given by the MRQA model and whose entity type is *organization* or something similar is highly likely to be a correct dataset name. Due to this pattern, they were able to create a neural network classifier to filter out candidate answers.

The classifier has the following architecture:

1.  Input size: 10332 (10331 labels from Ultra-Fine Entity Typing and one from the Document QA score)

2.  1 hidden layer with 50 neurons

3.  Output size: 2

The training set consists of 25172 examples and the test set of 6293 examples obtained from the training set provided by the competition. To train the network, Adam optimizer was used with cross entropy as the loss function.

Research Fields Retrieval
-------------------------

Their approach to obtain research fields is based on comparing the publications with Wikipedia articles using TF-IDF similarity. First, using the list of research fields provided by the competition, a set of Wikipedia articles about different research fields was obtained using the Python library MediaWiki. The list provided by the competition has three levels of hierarchy as shown in the example (Figure 7.2). The leaf nodes of that hierarchy were searched in Wikipedia to retrieve specific research fields instead of general ones. For example, they were aiming to retrieve *Neurosurgery* instead of *Medicine*. Then, using Scikit-learn [@scikit-learn], a TF-IDF matrix of all the publications and Wikipedia articles of research fields were computed. The research field and all its superior nodes in the hierarchy associated with the Wikipedia article most similar to the publication were returned along with the similarity in the range \[0,1\]. The overall architecture can be seen in Figure 7.3.

![Research fields hierarchy[]{label="fig:researchfieldshiearchy"}](combined_images/fieldshierarchy2.png)*Figure 7.2: Research fields hierarchy*

![Overall architecture for research fields retrieval[]{label="fig:researchfields"}](combined_images/researchfields2.png)*Figure 7.3:  Overall architecture for research fields retrieval*

Research Methods Retrieval
--------------------------

For the research methods retrieval task, they modeled it as a named-entity recognition (NER) problem. Research methods are considered to be named entities and because of this, they can be tagged as research method label (RS) instead of common NER labels such as *location*, and *people*. Figure 7.4 shows the main architecture of the model proposed by [@lample2016neural] and used in this task.

![BiLSTM-CRF architecture](combined_images/bi-lstm.png)*Figure 7.4: Paragraph selection for DocQA in research method retrieval*

The representation of a word using the model is obtained considering its context. The KAIST team had the assumption that research methods have dependencies and constraints with words that appear in their surrounding context. Therefore, the conditional random field [@lafferty2001conditional] layer in this model is suitable for detecting research methods by jointly tagging the whole sentence, instead of independently tagging each word.

For this task, the research method phrases that appeared in the training set were marked using as reference the list of research methods provided by the competition. Then, the training set was represented in CoNLL 2003 format [@tjong2003introduction], using IOB tag (Inside, Outside, Beginning) to train the model. Every token was labeled as B-RS if the token is the beginning of a research method, I-RS if it is inside a research method but not the first token, or O otherwise. Training the model took approximately one day using a CPU AMD Ryzen 7 2700, a GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, and 8GB RAM.

What worked and what didn’t
===========================
The KAIST team tried different ideas to extract dataset names. First, they tried to extract the dataset names using hand-crafted queries in the MRQA model. However, they noticed that these manually generated queries do not have sufficient discriminative power. Therefore, they tried to generate a general query with enough discriminative power to retrieve datasets' names. To this end, they converted the sentences containing the dataset into queries and then clustered the converted queries to get general queries. However, they found that each of the resulting clusters did not reflect the semantics of the desired general queries. Hence, they had to create specific queries for each publication as explained in the previous section. These specific queries helped to increase the recall but at the same time affected negatively to the precision. The use of entity typing worked well to remove the wrong candidate answers proposed by the MRQA model. Thanks to this entity-type filtering, they were able to improve the recall using the query generation module without sacrificing the precision.

They also tried to use the section names as a feature for the paragraph selection module of Document QA. However, the use of section names degraded the overall performance. In their analysis, they stated that the heuristics that they used to extract them generated noise that affected the performance. For example, *total*, *variable*, and *funding* were detected as section names but clearly, they are not.

Finally, their idea to compare publications with Wikipedia articles to retrieve research fields yielded successful results. But on the other hand, their first idea to retrieve research methods was not successful. It was based on identifying the context words of the research methods by using the frequency of those words. The reason for the bad performance was due to the lack of discriminative power of the most common words that co-occur with the research methods. Therefore, they tried to model it as a NER problem, where they consider each research method that appeared in a publication as a named-entity. By modeling the problem in this way, they could use existing NER models to extract research methods from publications. However, this approach did not achieve satisfactory results either.


Summary of your results and caveats
===================================

Due to the difficulty of performing a quantitative analysis on a not extensively labeled dataset, a qualitative analysis was made. Several random publications were chosen and manually labeled to check the quality of the model and discover the strong and weak points.

Datasets Retrieval
------------------

To analyze the effects of the query generation module and entity typing module, they performed analyses on 100 publications from the dev set of the first phase using three different settings:

1.  Document QA only

2.  Document QA + Query Generation Module

3.  Document QA + Query Generation Module + Entity Typing Module

### Document QA only

Figure 7.5 shows the results from three publications from the list of analyzed publications using *Document QA only*. Compared to the other settings, *Document QA only* setting retrieves high-quality answers (dataset mentions). However, the number of retrieved answers is notably small. For example, the result from *153.txt* publication is empty as shown in Figure 7.5. In fact, using this setting the model can only retrieve 260 answers (predictions) from the list of analyzed publications.

![Results from Document QA only[]{label="fig:docqaonly"}](combined_images/OnlyDocQA.png)*Figure 7.5: Results from Document QA only. Right answers from the model in blue.*

These results were expected due to the difficulty of defining general queries as explained in section [*Question Generation Module*](#query-generation-module). Without a query generation module, it is hard to make a representative enough query to retrieve various forms and types of the dataset mentions.

### Document QA + Query Generation Module

Figure 7.6 shows the results from three publications from the list of analyzed datasets using Document QA and the Query Generation Module. Because of the addition of the Query Generation Module, a larger number of answers were retrieved. For example, the result from *153.txt* publication contains several answers including the right one, *Micro Database Direct Investment*. Therefore, this and the retrieval of more than 2,000 answers from the list of analyzed datasets proves that the Query Generation Module improves recall of the entire dataset retrieval model. On the other hand, compared to the *Document QA only* setting, there is a considerable amount of wrong candidate answers. For instance, in Figure 7.6, *empirical*, *Table 1*, and *Section 4* are not dataset mentions.

![Results from Document QA + Query Generation Module[]{label="fig:docqaquery"}](combined_images/DocQA_QG.png)*Figure 7.6: Results from Document QA + query generation module. Right answers from the model in blue.*

They believe that the reason for this noise is that some query terms may cause the retrieval of wrong answers. For example, the query term *study* can help to retrieve dataset mentions such as *ANES 1952 Time Series Study*. However, this term can also retrieve wrong answers such as *empirical study*. These types of query terms are still needed to retrieve various forms and types of dataset mentions but clearly generate noise.

### Document QA + Query Generation Module + Entity Typing Module

Figure 7.7 shows the results of the analyzed publications using Document QA, the Query Generation Module, and the Entity Typing Module. Although the Entity Typing Module might not remove all the wrong answers caused by the Query Generation Module such as *4 2.1 Micro Data*, most of them are successfully removed and thus, the overall precision is improved. Using this setting the model retrieves 526 answers (predictions) from 100 publications from the dev set of the first phase of the competition.

![Results from Document QA + Query Generation Module + Entity Typing Module[]{label="fig:docqaqueryentity"}](combined_images/FullModel.png)*Figure 7.7: Results from Document QA + query generation module + entity typing module. Right answers from the model in blue.*

Research Fields Retrieval
-------------------------

They randomly selected 20 publications from the training set of the first phase. They can test their model using the training set because the model does not require any training phase. The model was able to predict research fields correctly for 11 of those publications. The strongest point is that the model is able to predict research fields that are significantly specific such as *Home health nursing management*. Among the weak points of the model, it has problems when two research fields are similar or share subtopics. Moreover, sometimes it fails due to the fact that it tries to retrieve excessively specific fields while more general ones would be suitable.

Research Methods Retrieval
--------------------------

20 random publications were selected and labeled from the training set of the second phase and the results are not satisfactory. The model is able to find proper research methods for 12 publications out of 20. For example, the model successfully detects the research method of the publication with id 15359, *Factor analysis*. However, the results contain a significant amount of noise. For example, the model retrieves for the document with id 10751 several wrong answers like *Reviews describe*, *Composite materials*, and *Detailed databases*.

Lessons learned and what would you do differently
=================================================
After the completion of this project, the KAIST team realized that some steps could have been in a different way and would have led to better results. For example, they focused a lot on the model creation, but they could have spent more time on the analysis of the dataset to extract all its potential and search for additional datasets to alleviate the noise of the provided dataset.

In addition, since Document QA is good for prototyping, it was a good idea to use it at the beginning to check that their hypothesis of modeling dataset retrieval as a Question Answering task was right. However, at some point during the project, they should have changed it to another model with state-of-the-art performance. Also, they use symbolic queries for the MRQA model. But since they are generating specific queries for each publication, it should be possible to define and generate queries in the form of embeddings. This could help to improve even more the recall boost provided by the Query Generation Module and at the same time avoid the generation of noise. Furthermore, for research fields, other ranking methods should have been tried like BM25, a ranking function used by search engines whose performance is better than TF-IDF. Finally, for research methods, they should have analyzed more the dataset to use more suitable techniques such as unsupervised NER instead of supervised NER.

Conclusion
===============
The KAIST team proposed to model the dataset retrieval task as a Question Answering task. This is a unique approach in this competition and led to successful results as shown in the analysis. This approach is flexible because it allows the retrieval of new datasets that are not in the training set. In addition, the model does not require to be trained on a dataset discovery task. They achieved good results even though they used a pre-trained model on SQuAD, a dataset for Question Answering using Wikipedia pages.
Their approach to retrieve research fields is simple, fast to compute, and powerful. It can retrieve specific research fields with high precision. On the other hand, the proposed approach to retrieve research methods did not achieve as good results as the other task. The main problem was that they did not tackle the noise problem in the dataset.

What comes next
===============

This work is the very first step of the Coleridge Initiative to build an "Amazon.com" for data users and data producers. The next step is to construct a system that recommends datasets to researchers. The KAIST team has the hypothesis that datasets depend on research fields and vice versa. For example, in the research field *Question Answering*, a subfield of *Natural Language Processing* and *Computer Science*, the most commonly used dataset is SQuAD [@rajpurkar2016squad]. Therefore, according to their hypothesis, two publications using SQuAD are presumably to be in the same field, *Question Answering*. Based on this hypothesis, it would be possible to build hierarchical clusters of publications with the same research field. In this way, a cluster will have publications with the same research field and similar datasets. As an example, the QA cluster will have papers about QA and those papers will use similar datasets like SQuAD and TriviaQA [@joshi2017triviaqa]. With these clusters, the system will be able to recommend datasets to data users. For example, if a publication is in the *Question Answering* field, the proposed system would be able to recommend the authors SQuAD and TriviaQA. Moreover, it would be able to recommend to data producers fields with a lack of datasets.

In addition,  there is room for improvement in the models they proposed. For example, since they used a pre-trained model in Document QA, they think they did not exploit the whole potential of this system, so they would like to train the model using a big enough training set of publications.

## 1. Introduction

GESIS - the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences (GESIS)\[1\] is
the largest European research and infrastructure provider for the social
sciences and offers research data, services and infrastructures
supporting all stages of the scientific process. The GESIS department
*Knowledge Technologies for the Social Sciences (WTS)*\[2\] is
responsible for developing all digital services and research data
infrastructures at GESIS and aims at providing integrated access to
social sciences data and services. Next to traditional social sciences
research data, such as surveys and census data, an emerging focus is to
build data infrastructures able to exploit novel forms of social
sciences research data, such as large Web crawls and archives.

Research at WTS\[3\] addresses areas such as Information Retrieval (IR),
Information Extraction (IE) & Natural Language
Processing (NLP), semantic technologies and human computer interaction
and aims at ensuring access and use of social sciences research data
along the FAIR principles, for instance, through interlinking of
research data, established vocabularies and knowledge graphs and by
facilitating semantic search across distinct platforms and datasets. Due
to the increasing importance of Web- and W3C standards as well as
Web-based research data platforms, in addition to traditional research
data portals, findability and interoperability of research data across
the Web constitutes one current challenge. In the context of Web-scale
reuse of social sciences resources, the extraction of structured data
about scholarly entities such as datasets and methods from unstructured
and semi-structured text, as found in scientific publications or
resource metadata, is crucial in order to be able to uniquely identify
social sciences resources and to understand their inherent relations.

Prior works at WTS/GESIS addressing such challenges apply NLP and
machine learning techniques to, for instance, extract and disambiguate
mentions of datasets\[4\] (Boland et al., 2012; Ghavimi et al., 2016)),
authors (Backes, 2018a, 2018b) or software tools (Boland and Krüger,
2019) from scientific publications or to extract and fuse scholarly data
from large-scale Web crawls (Sahoo et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2019).
Resulting pipelines and data are used to empower scholarly search
engines such as the *GESIS-wide search*\[5\] (Hienert et al., 2019)
which provides federated search for scholarly resources (datasets,
publications etc.) across a range of GESIS information systems or the
*GESIS DataSearch* platform\[6\] (Krämer et al., 2018), which enables
search across a vast number of social sciences research datasets mined
from the Web.

Given the strong overlap of our research and development profile with
the recent initiatives of the Coleridge Initiative to evolve this
research field through the Rich Context Competition (RCC)\[7\], we are
enthusiastic about having participated in the RCC2018 and are looking
forward to continue this collaboration towards providing sound
frameworks and tools which automate the process of interlinking and
retrieving scientific resources.

The central tasks in the RCC are the extraction and disambiguation of
mentions of datasets and research methods as well as the classification
of scholarly articles into a discrete set of research fields. After the
first phase, each team received feedback from the organizers of the RCC
consisting of a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Whereas
quantitative results of our inital contribution throughout phase one
have shown significant room for improvement, the qualitative
assessement, conducted by four judges on a sample of ten documents,
underlined the potential of our approach.

Since we have been shortlisted for the second phase of the RCC, this
chapter describes our approaches, techniques, and additional data used
to address all three tasks. As described in the following subsections,
we decided to follow a module-based approach where each module or the
entire pipeline can be reused. The remaining chapter is organised as
follows. The following Section 2 provides an overview
of our approach, used background data and preprocessing steps, whereas
Sections 3, 4, and 5 describe our approaches in more
detail, including results towards each of the tasks. Finally, we discuss
our results in Section 6 and provide an overview of
future work in Section 7.

## 2. Approach, data and pre-processing

This section describes the external data sources we used as well as our
pre-processing steps.

### 2.1 Approach overview and initial evaluation feedback

The central tasks in the RCC are the extraction of dataset mentions from
text. Even so, we considered the discovery of research methods and
research fields important. To this end, we decided to follow a
module-based approach. Users could choose to use each specific module
solely or as parts of a data processing pipeline.
Figure 8.2 shows an overview of
modules developed and their dependencies. Here, the upper three modules
(which are in gray) describe the pre-processing steps (cf.
Section 2.3). The lower four modules (blue) are used
to generate the output in a predefined format as specified by the
competition.

![image](combined_images/information-flow.png)
Figure 8.1: An overview of the individual software modules described in this
document and their dependencies. Gray: Our pre-processing pipeline. Blue: three main tasks of the RCC.

The pre-processing step consists of extracting metadata and raw text
from PDF documents. The output of this step is then used by the software
modules responsible for tackling the individual sub-tasks. These
sub-tasks are to discover research datasets (cf. Section 3),
methods (cf. Section 4) and fields (cf. Section 5). First, a Named Entity
Recognition module is used to find dataset mentions. This module used a
supervised approach trained on a weakly labled corpus. In the next step,
we combine all recognized mentions for each publication and compare
these mentions to the metadata from the list of datasets given by the
competition. For this linking step the mentions and year information
located in the same sentence are used. The corresponding sentence and
extracted information are saved for debugging and potential usage in
future pipeline components. The task of identifying research methods is
solved unsing a Named Entity Recognition and Linking module with
incorporated word embeddings and lexical resources. For identifying
research fields, we trained a classifier on openly available abstracts
and metadata from the domain of social sciences crawled from the Social
Science Open Access Repository\[8\] (SSOAR). We tried different
classifiers and selected the best performing one, a classifier based on
fasttext\[9\], i.e. a neural net based approach with a high
performance(Joulin et al., 2017).

After the first phase, each team received feedback from the organizers
of the RCC. The feedback is two folds, a quantitative and qualitative
evaluation. Unfortunately, the quantitative assessment showed our
algorithm for dataset mention retrieval did not perform well regarding
precision and recall metrics. In contrast to this, our approach has been
found convincing regarding the quality of results. The qualitative
feedback is based on a random sample of ten documents given to four
judges. The judges were asked to manually extract dataset mentions.
After this the overlap between their dataset extractions and the output
of our algorithm was calculated. Other factors that judges took into
consideration are specificity, uniqueness, and multiple occurrences of
dataset mentions. As for the extraction of research methods and fields,
no ground truth has been provided; these tasks were evaluated against
the judges’ expert knowledge. Similarly to the extraction of dataset
mentions, specificity and uniqueness have been considered for these two
tasks. The feedback our team received was overall positive.

### 2.2 External data sources

For developing our algorithms, we utilized two external data sources.
For the discovery of research methods and fields, we resort to data from
the Social Science Open Access Repository\[10\] (SSOAR). GESIS – Leibniz
Institute for the Social Sciences maintains SSOAR by collecting and
archiving literature of relevance to the social sciences.

In SSOAR, full texts are indexed using controlled social science
vocabulary (Thesaurus\[11\], Classification\[12\]) and are assigned rich
metadata. SSOAR offers documents in various languages. The corpus of
English language publications that can be used for purposes of the
competition consists of a total of 13,175 documents. All SSOAR documents
can be accessed through the OAI-PMH\[13\] interface.

Another external source we have used to discover research methods is the
ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (Bird et al., 2008). ACL ARC is a corpus
of scholarly publications about computational linguistics. The corpus
consists of a total of 22,878 articles.

### 2.3 Pre-processing

Although the organizers of the RCC offered plain texts for the
publication, we decided to build our own pre-processing pipeline. The
extraction of text from PDF files is still an error prone process. To
handle de-hyphenation and paragraph segmentation during extraction time
and benefit from automatic metadata extraction (i.e. title, author,
abstracts and references) we decided to use a third party extraction
tool. The Cermine Extraction Tool\[14\](Tkaczyk et al., 2015) transforms
the files into XML documents using the Journal Article Tag
Suite\[15\](Jats). For the competition we identified two interesting
elements of the Jats XML format, i.e., \(<\)front\(>\) and
\(<\)body\(>\). The \(<\)front\(>\) element contains the metadata of the
publication, whereas the \(<\)body\(>\) contains the main textual and
graphic content of the publication. As a last step of the
pre-processing, we removed all linebreaks from the publication. The
output of this step is a list of metadata fields and values, as shown in
Table 8.1 for each publication paragraph.

|                   | Example Text Field Data         |

## 3. Dataset extraction

### 3.1 Task description

In the scientific literature, datasets are cited to reference, for
example, the data on which an analysis is performed or on which a
particular result or claim is based. In this competition, we focus on
(i) extracting and (ii) disambiguating dataset mentions from social
science publications to a list of given dataset references. Identifying
dataset mentions in literature is a challenging problem due to the huge
number of styles of citing datasets. Although there are proposed
standards for dataset citation in full-texts, researchers still ignore
or neglect such standards (see, e.g., (Altman and King, 2007)).
Furthermore, in many research publications, a correct citation of
datasets is often missing (Boland et al., 2012). The following two
sentences exemplify the problem of the usage of an abbreviation to make
a reference to an existing dataset. The first example illustrates the
use of abbreviations that are known mainly in the author’s research
domain. The latter illustrates the ambiguity of abbreviations. In this
case, *WHO* identifies a dataset published by the World Health
Organization and does not refer to the institution itself.
**Example 1**: *P-values are reported for the one-tail paired t-test on
*Allbus* (dataset mention) and *ISSP* (dataset mention).*
**Example 2**: *We used *WHO data from 2001* (dataset mention) to
estimate the spreading degree of AIDS in Uganda.*
We treat the problem of detecting dataset mentions in full-text as a
Named Entity Recognition (NER) task.

#### Formal problem definition

Let \(D\) denote a set of existing datasets \(d\) and the knowledge base
\(K\) as a set of known dataset references \(k\). Furthermore, each
element of \(K\) is referencing an existing dataset \(d\). The Named
Entity Recognition and Linking task is defined as (i) the identification
of dataset mentions \(m\) in a sentence, where \(m\) references a
dataset \(d\) and (ii) linking them, when possible, to one element in
\(K\) (i.e., the reference dataset list given by the RCC).

### 3.2 Challenges

We focus on the extraction of dataset mentions in the body of the
full-text of scientific publications. There are three types of dataset
mentions: (i) The full name of a dataset (”National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey“), (ii) an abbreviation (”NHaNES“) or (iii) a vague
reference, e.g., ”the monthly statistic“. With all these these types,
the NER task faces special challenges. In the first case, the used
dataset name can vary in different publications. For instance one
publication cites the dataset with ”National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey“ the other could use the words ”Health and Nutrition
Survey“. In the case where abbreviations are used, a disambiguation
problem occurs, e.g., in ”WHO data“. WHO may describe the World Health
Organization or the White House Office. In the case, that an
abbreviation is used after the dataset name has been written in full,
the mapping between these different spellings in one text is referred to
as Coreference Resolution. The biggest challenge is again the lack of
annotated training data. In the following we describe how we have dealt
with this lack of ground truth data.

### 3.3 Phase one approach

Missing ground truth data is the main problem to handle during this
competition. To this end, supervised learning methods for dataset
mentions extraction from texts are not applicable without the
identification of external training data or the creation of useful
labeled training data from information given by the competition. Because
of the lack of existing training data for the task of dataset mention
extraction we resort to the provided list of dataset mentions and
publication pairs and re-annotate the particular sentences in the
publication text. A list of dataset identifying words is provided for
some of the known links between publications and datasets by the
competition. These words represent the evidence of the linkage between
publication and datasets and are extracted from the publication text. In
the course of re-annotation, we search for each of the identifying words
in the corresponding publication texts. For each match, we annotate the
occurence in our raw text and use these annotations as ground truth. As
described in the pre-processing section, our units for processing the
publication text are paragraphs. The re-annotated corpus consists of a
list of paragraphs for each publication with stand-off annotations
identifying the mentions of datasets (i.e. position of the start and end
characters and the entity type for each mention: *dataset*). This
re-annotation is then used to train Spacy’s neural network-based NER
model\[16\]. We created a holdout set of 1,000 publications and a
training set of size 4,000. Afterwards, we train our model with the
paragraphs as a sampling unit. In the training set, 0.45 percent of the
paragraphs contained mentions. For each positive training example, we
have added one negative sample that contains no known dataset mentions
and is randomly selected. We used a batch size of 25 and a dropout rate
of 0.4. The model was trained for 300 iterations.

#### Evaluation

We evaluated our model with respect to four metrics: precision and
recall, each for strict and for partial match. While the strict match
metrics are standard evaluation metrics, the partial match metrics are
their relaxed variants in which the degree to which dataset mentions
have to match can vary. Consider the following partial match example:
"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey" is the extracted
dataset mention, while "National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES)" is the true dataset mention. In contrast to the strict version
of the metrics, this overlapping match is considered a match for the
partial version. The scores describe whether a model is able to find the
correct positions of dataset mentions in the texts, even if the start
and end positions of the characters are not the same, but the ranges
overlap.

| Metric                    | Value |
| :------------------------ | :---: |
| Precision (partial match) | 0.93  |
| Recall (strict match)     | 0.95  |
| Precision (strict match)  | 0.80  |
| Recall (strict match)     | 0.81  |

Table 8.2: Performance of phase one approach of dataset extraction.

Table 8.2 shows the results of the dataset mention extraction on the holdout set. The
model can achieve high strict precision and recall values. As expected,
the results are even better for the partial version of the metrics. It
means that even if we couldn’t match the dataset mention in a text
exactly, we can find the right context with very high precision.

### 3.4 Phase two approach

In the second phase of the competition, additional 5,000 publications
were provided by RCC. We extended our approach to consider the list with
dataset names supplied by the organizers and re-annotated the complete
corpus of 15,000 publications in the same manner as in phase one to
obtain training data. This time we split the data in 80% for training
and 20% for test.

#### Evaluation

We resort to the same evaluation metrics as in phase one. However, we
calculate precision and recall on the full-text of the publication and
not on the paragraphs as in the first phase.
Table 8.3 shows the results achieved by our model. We observe lower precision and
recall values. Compared to phase one, there is also a smaller difference
between the precision and recall values for the strict and partial
version of the metrics.

| Metric                    | Value |
| :------------------------ | :---: |
| Precision (partial match) | 0.51  |
| Recall (partial match)    | 0.90  |
| Precision (strict match)  | 0.49  |
| Recall (strict match)     | 0.87  |

Table 8.3: Performance of phase two approach for dataset extraction.


## 4. Research method extraction

### 4.1 Task description

Inspired by a recent work of Nasar et al. (Nasar et al., 2018), we
define a list of basic entity types that give key-insights into
scholarly publications. We adapted the list of semantic entity types to
the domain of the social sciences with a focus on *research methods*,
but also including related entity types such as *theory, todel,
measurement, tool, performance*. We suspect that the division into
semantic types might be helpful to find *research methods*. The reason
is that the related semantic entities types might provide clues or might
be directly related to the research method itself.

For example, in order to achieve a certain research goal, an experiment
is used in which a certain combination of *methods* is applied to a
*dataset*. The methods can be specified as concepts or indirectly
through the use of certain *software*. The result is then quantified
with a *performance* using a specific measure.

**Example**: *P-values* (measurement) are reported for the *one-tail
paired t-test* (method) on *Allbus* (dataset) and *ISSP* (dataset).
We selected the entity types *research method*, *research theory*,
*research tool* and *research measurement* as the target research method
related entity types (see Table 8.4). This decision is based
on an ecxamination of the SAGE ontology given by the RCC as a sample of
how research method terms might look like.

|                            |                   |                                                  |
| :------------------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity type**            | **Corresponding** | **Examples**                                     |
|                            | **SAGE type**     |                                                  |
| Research Method            | SAGE-METHOD       | Bootstrapping, Active Interviews                 |
| Research Measurement       | SAGE-MEASURE      | Latent Variables, Phi coefficient, Z-score       |
| Research Theory            | SAGE-THEORY       | Frankfurt school, Feminism, Actor network theory |
| Research Tool              | SAGE-TOOL         | SPSS, R statistical package                      |

Table 8.4: Entity types of relevance for the research method extraction task.

#### Formal problem definition

The task of Named Entity Recognition and Linking is to (i) identify the
mentions \(m\) of research-related entities in a sentence and (ii) link
them, if possible, to a reference knowledge base \(K\) (i.e. the SAGE
Thesaurus\[17\]) or (iii) assign a type to each entity, e.g. a *research
method*, selected from a set of predefined types.

### 4.2 Challenges

There are some major challenges that any named entity recognition,
classification and linking system needs to handle. First, regarding NER,
identifying the entities boundary is important, thus detecting the exact
sequence span. Second, ambiguity errors might arise in classification.
For instance,‘range’ might be a domain-specific term from the knowledge
base or belong to the general domain vocabulary. This is a challenging
task for which context information is required. In the literature, this
relates to the problem of **domain adaptation** which includes
fine-tuning to specific named entity classes\[18\]. With respect to
entity linking, another challenge is detecting name variations, since
entities can be referred to in many different ways. Semantically similar
words, synonyms or related words, which might be lexically or
syntactically different, are often not listed in the knowledge base
(e.g., the lack of certain terms like ‘questioning’ but not
‘questionnaire’). This problem of automatically detecting these
relationships is generally known as **linking problem**. Note that part
of this problem also results from PDF-to-text conversion which is
error-prone. Dealing with incomplete knowledge bases, i.e. **handling of
out of vocabulary (OOV) items**, is also a major issue, since knowledge
bases are often not exhaustive enough and do not cover specific terms or
novel concepts from recent research. Last but not least, the combination
of different semantic types gives a more coherent picture of a research
article. We hypothesize that such information would be helpful and
results in an insightful co-occurrence statistics, and provides
additional detail directly related to entity resolution, and finally
helps to assess the **relevance of terms** by means of a score.

### 4.3 Our approach

Our research method extraction tool builds on Stanford’s CoreNLP and
Named Entity Recognition System\[19\]. The information extraction
process follows the workflow depicted in
figure 8.2, using separate modules for
pre-processing, classification, linking and term filtering.

![image](combined_images/research-methods-pipeline.png)
Figure 8.2: Overview of the entity extraction pipeline.

We envision the task of finding entities in scientific publications as a
sequence labeling problem, where each input word is classified as being
of a dedicated semantic type or not. In order to handle entities related
to our domain, we train a CRF based machine learning classifier with
major semantic classes, (see Table 8.4, using training material
from the ACL RD-TEC 2.0 dataset (QasemiZadeh and Schumann, 2016). Apart
from this, we follow a domain adaptation approach inspired by (Agerri
and Rigau, 2016) and ingest semantic background knowledge extracted from
external scientific corpora, in particular the ACL Anthology (Bird et
al., 2008; Gildea et al., 2018). We perform entity linking by means of a
new gazetteer based on th SAGE dictionary of Social Research
Methods (Lewis-Beck et al., 2003), thus putting a special emphasis on
the social sciences. The linking component addresses the synonymy
problem and matches an entity despite name variations such as spelling
variations. Finally, term filtering is carried out based on termhood and
unithood, while scoring is achieved by calculating a relevance score
based on TF-IDF (cf Table 8.6).

Our research experiments are based on publications from the Social
Science Open Access Repository (SSOAR)\[20\] as well as the train and
test data of the Rich Context Competition corpus\[21\]. Our work extends
previous work on this topic (cf. (Eckle-Kohler et al., 2013)) in various
ways: First, we do not limit our study to abstracts, but use the entire
fulltext. Second, we focus on a broader range of semantic classes, i.e.
*Research Method*, *Research Theory*, *Research Tool* and *Research
Measurement*, tackling also the problem of identifying novel entities.


#### Distributed semantic models

For domain adaptation, we integrate further background knowledge. We use
topical information from word embeddings trained on an scientific corpus
as an additional feature to our NER model. For this, we use
agglomerative clustering of the word embeddings to identify topical
groups of words. The cluster number of each word is used as additional
sequential input feature for our CRF model. Semantic representations of
words are a successful extension of common features, resulting in higher
NER performance (Turian et al., 2010) and can be trained offline. In
this work, the word vectors were learned based on 22,878 documents of
the scientific ACL Anthology Reference Corpus\[22\] using Gensim\[23\]
with the skip-gram model (cf. (Mikolov et al., 2013)) and a
pre-clustering algorithm\[24\].

#### Features

The features incorporated into the linear chain CRF are shown in the
Table 8.5. The features depend mainly on
the observations and on pairs of adjacent labels, using a log-linear
combination. However, since simple token level training of CRFs leads to
poor performance, more effective text features such as word shape,
orthographic, gazetteer, Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags, along with word
clustering have been used.

| **Type**                 |                            **Features**                            |

Table 8.5: Features used for NER.

#### Knowledge resources

We use the SAGE thesaurus which includes well-defined concepts, an
explicit taxonomic hierarchy between concepts as well as labels that
specify synonyms of the same concept. A portion of terms is unique to
the social science domain (e. g., ‘dependent interviewing’), while
others are drawn from related disciplines such as statistics (e. g.,
‘conditional likelihood ratio test’)\[25\]. However, since the
thesaurus is not exhaustive and covers only the top-level concepts
related to social science methods, our aim was to extend it by
automatically extracting further terms from domain-specific texts, in
particular from the Social Science Open Access Repository. More
concretely, we carried out the following steps to extend SAGE as an
off-line step. For step 2 and 3, candidate terms have been extracted by
our pipeline for the entire SSOAR corpus.

1.  Assignment of semantic types to concepts (manual)

2.  Extracting terms variants such as abbreviations, synonyms, related
    terms from SSOAR (semi-automatic)

3.  Computation of term and document frequency scores for SSOAR
    (automatic)

#### Extracting term variants such as abbreviations, synonyms, and related terms

26,082 candidate terms have been recognized and classified by our
pipeline and manually inspected to a) find synonyms and related words
that could be linked to SAGE, and b) build a post-filter for incorrectly
classified terms. Moreover, abbreviations have been extracted using the
algorithm of Schwartz and Hearst (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003). This way,
a Named Entity gazetteer could be built and is used at run-time. It
comprises 1,111 terms from SAGE and 447 terms from the used glossary of
statistical terms\[26\] as well as 54 previously unseen terms detected
by the model-based classifier.

#### Computation of term and document frequency scores

Term frequency statistics have been calculated off-line for the entire
SSOAR corpus. The term frequency at corpus level will be used at run
time to determine the term relevance at the document level by
calculating the TF-IDF scores. The most relevant terms from SAGE are
listed in Table 8.6.

Table 8.6: Most relevant terms from SAGE by Semantic Type.

#### Definition of a relevance score

Relevance of terminology is often assessed using the notion of
*unithood*, i.e. ‘the degree of strength or stability of syntagmatic
combinations of collections’, and *termhood*, i.e. ‘the degree that a
linguistic unit is related to domain-specific concepts’ (Kageura and
Umino, 1996). Regarding *unithood*, the NER model implicitly contains
heuristics about legal POS tag sequences for candidate terms, consisting
of at least one noun (NN), preceeded or followed by modifiers such as
adjectives (JJ), participles (VB\*) or cardinal numbers (CD),
complemented by wordshape features.

In order to find out if the candidate term also fulfills the *termhood*
requirement, domain-specific term frequency statistics have been
computed on the SSOAR repository, and set in contrast to general domain
vocabulary terms. It has to be noted that only a small portion of the
social science terms is actually unique to the domain (e.g., ‘dependent
interviewing’), while others might be drawn from related disciplines
such as statistics (e.g., ‘conditional likelihood ratio test’).

#### Preliminary results

Our method has been tested on 100 fulltext papers from SSOAR and ten
documents from the Rich Context Competition (RCC), all randomly selected
from a hold out corpus. In our experiments on SSOAR Social Science
publications, we compared results to the given metadata information. The
main finding was that while most entities from the SAGE thesaurus could
be extracted and linked reliably (e.g., ’Paired t-test’), they could not
be easily mapped to the SSOAR metadata terms, which consist of only a
few abstract classes (e.g., ’quantitative analysis’). Furthermore, our
tool was tested by the RCC organizer, were the judges reviewed ten
random publications and generated qualitative scores for each document.
In this evaluation, the research method extraction tool received the
overall best results of all competitors for this task.\[27\]

## 5. Research field classification

### 5.1 Task description

The goal of this task is to identify the research fields covered in the
social science publications. In general, two approaches could be applied
to this task. One is the extraction of relevant terms of the
publications. It means that this task could be seen as a keyword
extraction task and the detected terms considered as descriptive terms
regarding the research field. The second approach is to learn to
classify publications research fields with the use of annotated data in
a superviesed manner. The benifit of the second approach is that the
classification scheme to describe the research field can be defined by
experts of the domain. The disadvantage of supervised trained
classifiers for this task is the lack of applicable training data.
Furthermore, it must be ensured that the training data is comparable to
the texts the research field classifier should be applied on.

#### Formal problem definition

Let \(P\) denote a set of publications of size \(n\), \(A\) a set of
corresponding abstracts of the same size and \(L\) a set of \(k\)
defined class labels describing research fields. The task of research
field classification is to select for each publication \(p_i\in{P}\)
based on the information contained in the corresponding abstract
\(a_i\in{A}\) a set of labels
\(C_i = \varnothing \cap \{c_1\dots c_n|c_n \in L\}\) of \(n\) labels.
The number of \(n\) denotes the number of labels from \(L\) describing
the research field of \(a_i\) and can vary for each publication \(p_i\).
If there is no label \(l_k\) representing the information given by the
abstract \(a_i\) the set of class labels is the empty set
\(\varnothing\).

### 5.2 Our approach

Since we didn’t receive any gold standard for this task during the
competition we decided to make use of external resources. We decided to
use an external labeled dataset to train a text classifier which is able
to predict one or moreresearch label for a given abstract of a
publication.

The publications given througout the competition belongs to the domain
of social sciences we considered metadata from a open access repository
for the social sciences called SSOAR. The advantages are twofold. On the
one hand, we could rely on professional annotations in a given
classification scheme covering the social sciences and related areas. On
the other hand the source is openly available.\[28\]

The annotated data of SSOAR contains four different annotation schemes
for research field related information. By reviewing these schemes, we
decided to use the Classification Social Science (classoz) annotation
scheme. The number of classes in each schema, coverage of each
classification, and the distribution of data in each schema affected our
decision. An exhausitve description of the used data can be found in
Section 8.2.

#### Pre-processing and model architecture

SSOAR is a multilingual repository. Therefore, the available abstracts
may vary in language and the language of the abstract may differ from
the language of the article itself. We selected all English abstract
with valid classification as our dataset. Mainly because of the language
of the RCC corpus. However, it should be noted that the multilingual
SSOAR abstract corpus has a skewed distribution of languages with
English and German as the main languages. We count 22,453 English
abstracts with valid classification after filtering. Due to the unequal
distribution of labels in the dataset, we need to guaranty enough
training data for each label. We selected only labels with frequency
over 300 for training the model, which results in a total of 44 out of
154 classification labels representing research fields. For creating
train and test set, 22,453 SSOAR publications with their assigned labels
were split randomly. We used a train/validation/test split of 70/10/20.
We decided to train a text classifier based on a fasttext (Joulin et
al., 2017) model in the author’s implementation. The arguments to use
this model was the speed in comparison to a more complex neural net
architecture and the still comparable to state of the art performance
(e.g.(Wang et al., 2018)). The model is trained with learning rate 1.0
for 150 epochs. Also, the negative sampling parameter is set to 25.

### 5.3 Evaluation

Figure 8.3 shows the performance of the model regarding various evaluation metrics
for different thresholds. A label is assigned to a publication if the
model outputs a probability for the label above the defined threshold.
In multi-label classification, this allows us to evaluate our model from
different perspectives. As illustrated in figure 8.3,
the intersection of the micro precision and the micro recall curves is
at the threshold of 0.1, where the highest micro f1 score is achieved.
By increasing the threshold from this point, the micro-precision score
is increasing, but the micro recall is falling. By decreasing threshold,
these trends are inverted. Also, the default threshold of 0.5 doesn’t
look promising. In spite of micro-precision about 0.75, we have a
problem with the very high number of items without any prediction. In
respect to this observation it is advantageous to select a lower
threshold in a productive environment. The curve named *without
prediction* shows for a given threshold the share of publications in the
test set without any prediction. If the selected threshold value is
high, the number of publications for which the model cannot predict a
research field increases. For example, a selected threshold value of
0.55 leads to 40% unclassified publications in the test set. The *one
correct* named curve indicates the quality of the publication wise
prediction. It shows the share of all publications in the test set where
at least one of the predicted research field labels can be found in the
ground truth data. For instance, if a threshold of 0.1 is selected for
75% of the publications in the test set, at least one of the model
predictions are correct. This value decreases with increasing threshold
simmilar to the recall metric. The final micro f1 value on the test set
for our model and a selected threshold of 0.1 is 0.56 (precison 0.55,
recall 0.56).

## 6. Discussions and Limitations

### 6.1 Dataset Extraction.

For the dataset extraction task, the proposed methods are only tested on
social science related data. The performance measures we have introduced
are based on a hold out data set of our automatically created dataset.
Especially the recall may be biased given that our training as well as
testing data is biased towards known datasets, where datasets not yet
part of our reference set are not considered.

The results of the second phase presented during the RCC workshop\[29\]
are showing good performance of our approach in comparison to the other
finalist teams with the highest precision 52.2% (second: 47.0%) and
second in recall (ours: 20.5, best: 34.8%). With respect to F1, our
approach provides the second best performing system for this task
(29.5%, 40.0% for first place). The results on the manually created hold
out set underline, that our system performs better in respect to
precision in comparison to the other finalist teams. Given that our
models are supervised through a corpus of social sciences publications,
we anticipate limited generalisability across other disciplines and plan
to investigate this aspect as part of future work. In this context, the
focus of our training data towards survey data, also reflected in
dataset titles such as *Current Population Survey*, could have biased
the model to detect the survey as a specific type of research datasets
better than other subtypes like e.g. text corpora in the NLP community.
In general, however, our approach to using a weakly labeled corpus
created from a list of dataset names could be applied in other research
domains.

### 6.2 Research method extraction.

We consider the extraction of research methods from full text as a
particularly challenging task because the sample vocabulary given by the
RCC organizers covers a large thematic variety of areas. The task itself
was defined as the identification of research methods associated with a
specific publication, which in turn are drawn from a specific research
field. Since no training data has been provided, we created and
annotated a new corpus for the task and trained a CRF model, adding
lexical resources. The qualitative reviews during the two phases of the
competition attested that this approach works fine.

### 6.3 Research field classification.

Our supervised machine learning approach to handle the research field
classification task performs well on the dataset created from social
science publication metadata. A micro F1 measure of above 55% seems to
indicate reasonable performance considering the small dataset with
44 labels and a mean number of keywords of three terms per publication.
As one example of multilabel classification with a comparable size of
labels we would like to mention the classification of texts in the
domain of medicine presented in (Wang et al., 2018). The models tested
by the authors on the task of multilabel prediction from 50 different
labels leads to micro F1 values between 53% and 62%.
Considering the evaulation approach, focused on publications from the
social sciences, the generalisability across other disciplines remains
unclear and requires further research. Even though the used
classification scheme may cover neighbouring disciplines, for instance,
medicine, the numbers of samples of the training data covering other
research fields than the social science is limited. Our pragmatic
approach of basing our classifications on the abstract of the
publications makes it applicable even in scenarios where the full-text
of publications is not accessible.

## 7. Conclusion

This chapter has provided an overview on our solutions submitted to the
Rich Context Competition 2018. Aimed at improving search, discovery and
interpretability of scholarly resources, we are addressing three
distinct tasks all aimed at extracting structured information about
research resources from scientitifc publications, namely the extraction
of dataset mentions, the extraction of mentions of research methods and
the classification of research fields.

In order to address all aforementioned challenges, our pipelines make
use of a range of preprocessing techniques together with
state-of-the-art NLP methods as well as supervised machine learning
approaches tailored towards the specific nature of scholarly
publications as well as the dedicated tasks. In addition, background
datasets have been used to facilitate supervision of methods at larger
scale.

Our results indicate both significant opportunities for automating the
aforementioned three tasks but also their challenging nature, in
particular given the lack of publicly available gold standards for
training and testing. Aggregating and publishing such data has been
identified as important activity for future work, and is a prerequisite
for significantly advancing state-of-the-art methods.

# Chapter 9 - Finding datasets in publications: The University of Paderborn approach

Abstract
=================

The steadily increasing number of publications available to researchers
    makes it difficult to keep track of the state of the art. In particular,
    tracking the datasets used, topics addressed, experiments performed and
    results achieved by peers becomes increasingly tedious. Current academic
    search engines render a limited number of entries pertaining to this
    information. However, having this knowledge would be beneficial for
    researchers to become acquainted with all results and baselines relevant
    to the problems they aim to address. With our participation in the NYU
    Coleridge Initiative’s Rich Context Competition, we aimed to provide
    approaches to automate the discovery of datasets, research fields and
    methods used in publications in the domain of Social Sciences. We
    trained an Entity Extraction model based on Conditional Random Fields
    and combined it with the results from a Simple Dataset Mention Search to
    detect datasets in an article. For the identification of Fields and
    Methods, we used word embeddings. In this chapter, we describe how our
    approaches performed, their limitations, some of the encountered
    challenges and our future agenda.

Literature Review
=================

Previous works on information retrieval from scientific articles are
mainly seen in the field of Bio-medical Sciences and Computer Science,
with systems [@DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18] built using the
MEDLINE[^1] abstracts, full-text articles from PubMed Central[^2] or ACL
Anthology dataset[^3]. The documents belonging to the above-mentioned
datasets follow a similar format, and thus, several metadata and
bibliographical extraction frameworks like CERMINE [@tkaczyk2014cermine]
have been built on them. However, since articles belonging to the domain
of Social Sciences do not follow a standard format, extracting key
sections and metadata using already existing frameworks like
GROBID [@lopez2009grobid], ScienceParse[^4] or
ParsCit [@councill2008parscit] did not seem as viable options, majorly
because these systems were still under development and lacked certain
desired features. Hence, building upon the approach of Westergaard et.
al [@DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18], we built our own
sections-extraction framework for dataset detection and research fields
and methods identification.

Apart from content and metadata extraction, key-phrase or topic
extraction from scientific articles has been another emerging research
problem in the domain of information retrieval from scientific articles.
Jansen et al. [@jansen2016extracting] extracted core claims from
scientific articles by first detecting keywords and key-phrases using
rule-based, statistical, machine learning and domain-specific approaches
and then applying document summarization techniques. For characterizing
a research work in terms of its focus, application domain and techniques
used, Gupta et al. [@gupta2011analyzing] proposed applying semantic
extraction patterns to the dependency trees of sentences in an article’s
abstract. On the other hand, to thematically represent scientific
articles and for ranking the extracted key-phrases, Mahata et
al. [@mahata2018key2vec] devised an approach for processing text
documents to train phrase embeddings.

The problem of dataset detection and methods and fields identification
is not only different from the ones mentioned above, but also our
approach for tackling it is radically disparate. The following sections
describe our approach in detail.

Project Architecture
====================

![Data Flow Pipeline: Red lines depict the flow of given and generated
files between components whereas black lines represent the generation of
final output
files[]{data-label="fig:flowchart"}](combined_images/flowchart_paper.pdf){width="\textwidth"}

Our pipeline (shown in Figure \[fig:flowchart\]) consisted of three main
components: 1) Preprocessing, 2) Fields and Methods Identification and
3) Dataset Extraction. The Preprocessing module read the text from
publications and generated some additional files (see
Section \[preprocess\] for details). These files along with the given
Fields and Methods vocabularies were used to infer Research Fields and
Methods from the publications. Then, the information regarding Research
Fields was passed onto the Dataset Detection module and using the
Dataset Vocabulary, Dataset Citations and Mentions were identified. The
following sections provide a detailed overview of each of these
components.

Preprocessing
=============

As discussed in Chapter 5, the publications were provided in two
formats: PDF and text. For Phase-1, we used the given text files,
however during Phase-2, we came across many articles in the training
files that had not been properly converted to text and contained mostly
non-ASCII characters. To work with such articles, we relied on the open
source tool `pdf2text` from `poppler suite`[^5] to extract text from
PDFs. The `pdf2text` command served as the first preprocessing step and
was called as a subprocess from within a python script. It was used with
`-nopgbrk` argument to generate the text files.

Once we had the text files, we followed the rule-based approach as
proposed by Westergaard et al. [@DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18]
for pre-processing. The following series of operations based mostly on
regular expressions were performed:

-   Words split by hyphens were de-hyphenated

-   Irrelevant data was removed (i.e., equations, tables,
    acknowledgment, references);

-   Main sections (i.e., abstract, keywords, JEL-Classification,
    methodology/data, summary, conclusion) were identified and
    extracted;

-   Noun phrases from these sections were extracted (using the python
    library, spaCy[^6]).

We came up with the heuristics for identifying the main sections after
going through the articles from different domains in the training data.
We collected the surface forms for the headings of all major sections
(abstract, keywords, introduction, data, approach, summary, discussion)
and applied regular expressions to search for them and separate them
from one another. The headings and their corresponding content were
stored as key-value pairs in a file. For generating noun-phrases, this
file was parsed and for all the values (content) in key-value
(heading-content) pairs, a spaCy object, `doc`, was created
sentence-wise. Using the built-in function for extracting noun chunks
([`doc.noun_chunks`]{}), we generated key-value pairs of heading and
noun-phrases found in the content and stored them in another file. This
file was later used for fields and methods identification.

To determine how well our approach performed in distinguishing sections,
we evaluated it on the articles in the validation dataset. During
evaluation, we figured out the limiting cases of our approach. A section
could not be differentiated either when there was no explicit mention of
any of its surface forms or if there were multiple mentions of the
surface forms in the articles. For instance, in the validation dataset
(see Table \[tab:sections\]), keywords were not extracted from 13
articles because of no explicit mention of the term ’keywords’ or its
variants. On manual inspection, we found keywords were actually not
mentioned in these 13 articles. In the remaining articles where the
keywords were present, our algorithm could not detect them from 1
article. For brevity, we have reported only four main sections in
Table \[tab:sections\]: title, abstract, keywords and methodology/data,
since these are the ones getting preferential treatment in methods and
fields identification. If a section was not found in the article
(because of no explicit mention of any of the surface forms), then only
the sections that could be detected were extracted. The remaining
content was saved as `reduced_content` after cleaning and noun-phrases
were extracted from it to prevent loss of any meaningful data.

[C[4cm]{} C[3.5cm]{} C[4cm]{}]{} **Sections** & **No explicit mention**
& **Mentioned but not distinguished**  
Title & 0 & 0  
Keywords & 13 & 1  
Abstract & 0 & 1  
Methodology/Data & 18 & 4  

In addition to the main sections, we also extracted PDF metadata using
`pdfinfo` service from the `poppler suite` library. The metadata very
often contained the keywords and subject of an article, which was
helpful in those cases where the keywords were not found by the regular
expression.  
In the end, the preprocessing module generated four text files for a
publication: PDF-converted text, PDF-metadata, processed articles
containing relevant data, and noun phrases from the relevant sections,
respectively. These files were then passed on to the other two
components of the pipeline, which have been discussed below.

Approach
========

Research Fields and Methods Identification
------------------------------------------

### Vocabulary Generation and Model Preperation

1.  **Research Methods Vocabulary**: In Phase-1 of the challenge, we
    used the given methods vocabulary. However, the feedback that we
    received from Phase-1 evaluation gave more emphasis to statistical
    methods used by the authors, references to the time scope, unit of
    observation, and regression equations rather than the means used to
    compile the data, i.e., surveys. Since the given methods vocabulary
    was not a complete representation of statistical methods and also
    consisted terms depicting surveys, in Phase-2, we decided to create
    our own Research Methods Vocabulary using Wikipedia and DBpedia.[^7]
    We manually curated a list of all the relevant statistical methods
    from Wikipedia[^8] and fetched their descriptions from the
    corresponding DBpedia resources. For each label in the vocabulary,
    we extracted noun phrases from its description and added them to the
    vocabulary. Please refer Table \[tab:vocab\] for examples.

    Bayesian statistics, developed in 2004 by physicist John Skilling. &
    algorithm, a computational approach, the problem, comparing models,
    Bayesian statistics, physicist John Skilling  

2.  **Research Fields Vocabulary**: For both the phases, we used the
    given research fields vocabulary and, just like the methods
    vocabulary, supplemented it with the noun phrases from the
    description of the research field labels. However, since our phase-1
    model seemed to confuse fields with methods, for Phase-2, we
    additionally created a stopword-list of terms that didn’t contain
    any domain-specific information, such as; Mixed Methods, Meta
    Analysis, Narrative Analysis and the like.

3.  **Word2Vec Model generation**: In this pre-processing step, we used
    the above-mentioned vocabulary files containing noun phrases to
    generate a vector model for both research fields and methods. The
    vector model was generated by using the labels and noun phrases from
    the description of the available research fields and methods to form
    a sum vector. The sum vector was basically the sum of all the
    vectors of the words present in a particular noun phrase. 3em [The
    pre-trained Word2Vec model
    `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin` [@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781]
    was used to extract the vectors of the individual words.]{}

4.  **Research Method training results creation**: For research methods,
    we generated an intermediate result file with the publications
    present in the training data. It was generated using a
    `naïve finder algorithm` which, for each publication, selected the
    research method with the highest cosine similarity to any of its
    noun phrase’s vectors. This file was later used to assign weights to
    research methods using Inverse Document Frequency.

### Processing with Trained Models

-   **Finding Research Fields and Methods:** To find the research fields
    and methods for a given list of publications, we performed the
    following steps: (At first, Step 1 was executed for all the
    publications, thereafter Step 2 and 3 were executed iteratively for
    each publication).

    1.  **Naïve Research Method Finder run** - In this step, we executed
        the `naïve research method finding algorithm` (i.e. selected a
        research method based on the highest cosine similarity between
        vectors) against all the current publications and then merged
        the results with the existing result from the
        `research methods’ preprocessing step`. The combined result was
        then used to generate IDF weight values for each
        `research method`, to compute the significance of recurring
        terms.

    2.  **IDF-based Research Method Selection** - We re-ran the
        algorithm to find the closest research method to each noun
        phrase and then sorted the pairs based on their weighted cosine
        similarity. The weights were taken from the IDF values generated
        in the first step and the manual weights assigned (section-wise
        weighting). Here, the noun phrases that came from the
        methodology section and from the methods listed in
        JEL-classification (if present) were given a higher preference.
        The pair with the highest weighted cosine similarity was then
        chosen as the Research Method of the article.

    3.  **Research Field Finder run** - In this step, we first found the
        closest research field from each noun phrase in the publication.
        Then we selected the Top N (= 10) pairs that had the highest
        weighted cosine similarity. Afterwards, the noun phrases that
        had a similarity score less than a given threshold (= 0.9) were
        filtered out. The end-result was then passed on to a
        post-processing algorithm.  
        For weighted cosine similarity, the weights were assigned
        manually based on the section of publication from which the noun
        phrases came. In general, noun phrases from title and keywords
        (if present) were given a higher preference than other sections,
        since usually these two sections hold the crux of an article.
        Note, if sections could not be discerned from an article, then
        noun phrases from the section, reduced\_content (see section
        \[preprocess\]), were used to find both fields and methods.

    4.  **Research Field Selection** - The top-ranked term from the
        result of step 3, which was not present in the stopword-list of
        irrelevant terms, was marked as the research field of the
        article.

The experimental set-up and average training times (ATT) have been
reported in Table \[tab:setup\]:

Dataset Extraction
------------------

For identifying the datasets in a publication, we followed two
approaches and later combined results from both. Both the approaches
have been described below.

1.  **Simple Dataset Mention Search:** We chose the dataset citations
    from the given Dataset Vocabulary that occurred for one dataset only
    and used these unique mentions to search for the corresponding
    datasets using regular expressions in the text documents. Then, we
    computed a frequency distribution of the datasets. As can be seen
    from Figure \[fig:graph\], certain dataset citations occurred more
    often than others. This is because while searching for dataset
    citations, apart from the dataset title, the corresponding
    mention\_list from Dataset Vocabulary was also considered, which
    contained many commonly occurring terms like ‘time’, ‘series’, ‘time
    series’, ‘population’ etc. Therefore, we filtered out those dataset
    citations that occurred more than a certain threshold value (=1.20)
    multiplied by the median of the frequency distribution and that had
    less than 3 distinct mentions in a publication. The remaining
    citations were written to an interim result file.
    Table \[tab:simple\] depicts the improvement in performance of
    Simple Dataset Mention Search with the inclusion of filtering. The
    filtering process improved the F1-measure by 42.86%. Note, as the
    validation data consisted of only 100 articles, changing the
    threshold value to 1.10 or 1.30 didn’t result in any significant
    change, hence we have maintained a constant threshold value of 1.20
    in our comparison table.

    ![Frequency Distribution of Dataset
    Citations[]{data-label="fig:graph"}](combined_images/freq.pdf)

2.  **Rasa-based Dataset Detection:** In our second approach, we trained
    an entity extraction model based on conditional random fields (CRF)
    using Rasa NLU [@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1712-05181]. For training
    the model we used the Spacy Tokenizer[^9] for the preprocessing
    step. For Entity Recognition we used BILOU tagging and used 50
    iterations to train the CRF. We used the Part of Speech tags, the
    case of the input tokens and the suffixes of the tokens as input
    features for the CRF model. We particularly tested two
    configurations for training the CRF-based Named Entity Recognition
    (NER) model. In Phase-1, the 2500 labeled publications from the
    training dataset were used for training the Rasa NLU[^10] model.
    Later in Phase-2, when the Phase-1 holdout corpus was released, we
    combined its 5000 labeled publications with the previously given
    2500 labeled publications and then retrained the model again with
    these 7500 labeled publications.  
    **Running the CRF-Model:** The trained model was run against the
    preprocessed data to detect dataset citations and mentions. Only the
    entities that had a confidence score greater than a certain
    threshold value (= 0.72) were considered as dataset mentions. A
    dataset mention was considered as a citation only if it was found in
    the given Dataset Vocabulary (via string matching either with a
    dataset title or any of the terms in a dataset ‘mention\_list’) and
    if it belonged to the research field of the article. To check if a
    dataset belonged to the field of research, we found the cosine
    similarity of the terms in the ‘subjects’ field of the Dataset
    Vocabulary with the keywords and the identified Research Field of
    the article.

3.  **Combining the two approaches:** The output generated by the
    Rasa-based approach was first checked for irrelevant citations
    before a union was performed to combine the results. This was done
    by checking if a given dataset\_id occured more than a threshold
    value (= 1.20) multiplied by the median of the frequency
    distribution (same as the filtering process of the Simple Dataset
    Mention Search).

Note that, the threshold values mentioned above were set after some
experiments of trial and testing. For dataset extraction, the goal was
to keep the number of false positives low while not compromising the
true positives. For research methods and fields, a manual evaluation
(see the next section for details) was done to test if the results made
sense with the articles.

Evaluation
==========

We performed a quantitative evaluation for Dataset Extraction using the
evaluation script provided by the competition organizers (refer Chapter
5 for more details). This evaluation (see Table \[tab:dataset\]) was
carried out against the validation data, wherein we compared four
different configurations. As can be inferred from the table, there was
only a slight increase in performance for the Rasa-based model, when the
training samples were increased. However, combining it with the Simple
Dataset Mention Search, increased the performance by *19.42%*.
Interestingly, there was no improvement in performance in the combined
approach even when the training samples for the Rasa-based model were
increased. This might be because of the removal of frequently-occuring
terms from the Rasa-generated output, based on the frequency
distribution of dataset mentions as computed in the Simple Dataset
Mention Search.

For Research Fields and Methods, we carried out a qualitative evaluation
against 10 randomly selected articles from Phase-1 holdout corpus.
Tables \[tab:field\] and \[tab:method\] depict a comparison between the
predicted fields and methods in Phase-1 and Phase-2. In general, our
models returned a more granular output in the second phase, solely
because of the modifications we made in the vocabularies.

Discussion
==========

Throughout the course of this competition, we encountered several
challenges and limitations in all the three stages of the pipeline. In
the preprocessing step, the appropriate extraction of text from PDFs
turned out to be rather challenging. This was especially due to the
varied formats of the publications, which made the extraction of
specific sections—that contained all data relevant to our
work—demanding. As mentioned before, if there was no explicit mention of
the key-terms like
`Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Methodology/Data, Summary, Conclusion`
in the text, then the content was saved as ‘reduced\_content’ after
applying all other preprocessing steps and filtering out any irrelevant
data.  
Our experiments suggest that the labeled publications we received for
dataset detection were not uniform in the dataset mentions provided,
which made it difficult to train an entity extraction model even with an
increased number of training samples. Hence, there was only a slight
improvement in performance when the Rasa-model was trained with 7500
publications instead of 2500. This was also why we combined the
Rasa-based approach with the Simple Dataset Mention Search, so that at
least the datasets that were present in the vocabulary do not get
missed.

Regarding the fields and methods, vocabularies played an immense role in
their identification. The vocabularies that were provided by the SAGE
publications contained some terms that were either polysemous or very
high-level and therefore, were picked up by our model very often. Hence,
for research methods, we created our own vocabulary containing all the
relevant statistical methods, and for fields, we introduced a
stopword-list of irrelevant terms and looked it up each time, before
writing the result to the output file. The goal of stopword-list
generation was to filter the terms that did not carry domain-specific
information and sounded more like research methods than fields. Since
the focus was on more granulated results, we tried to look for open
ontologies for Social Science Fields and Methods and unfortunately,
could not find any. It is worth mentioning that since our approach for
Fields and Methods identification relied heavily upon vocabularies, it
could not find any new methods or fields from the publications.

Based on the final evaluation feedback, since our Phase-2 models did not
perform as good as we expected, following are a few things that we could
have done differently.

1.  For research methods, merging the given SAGE methods vocabulary with
    our manually curated vocabulary, could have resulted in methods that
    would have been both granular and statistical while still being
    relevant to the publications. Introducing a stopword-list just as we
    did for research field identification, could also have been another
    workaround.

2.  For both fields and methods identification, we could have also tried
    pre-trained embeddings from glove[^11] and fastText[^12].

3.  As our entity-extraction approach for Dataset Detection suffered
    from a limitation of inconsistent labels (i.e. datasets mentioned in
    the form of abbreviation, full-name, collection procedure, and
    keywords) in training data, we could have extended the Simple
    Dataset Mention Search to a pattern-oriented search based on
    handcrafted rules derived from sentence structure and other
    heuristics.

Future Agenda
=============

The data provided to us in the competition displayed a cornucopia of
inconsistencies even after human processing. We hence propose that
machine-aided methods for computing correct and complete structured
representation of publications are of central importance for scientific
research such as an Open Research Knowledge
Graph [@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1901-10816][@DBLP:conf/esws/BuscaldiDMOR19].
Previous works on never-ending learning have shown how humans and
extraction algorithms can work together to achieve high-precision and
high-recall knowledge extraction from unstructured sources. In our
future work, we hence aim to populate a **scientific knowledge graph**
based on never-ending learning. The methodology we plan to develop will
be domain-independent and rely on active learning to classify, extract,
link and publish scientific research artifacts extracted from
open-access papers. Inconsistency will be remedied by ontology-based
checks learned from other publications such as SHACL constraints which
can be manually or automatically added.[^13] The resulting graphs will

-   rely on advanced distributed storage for RDF to scale to the large
    number of publications available;

-   be self-feeding, i.e., crawl the web for potentially relevant
    content and make this content available for processing;

-   be self-repairing, i.e., be able to update previous extraction
    results based on insights gathered from new content;

-   be weakly supervised by humans (e.g. authors of publications), who
    would assist in correcting wrong hypotheses, thereby leveraging
    semi-supervised learning;

-   provide standardized access via W3C Standards such as SPARQL.

Having such knowledge graphs would make it easier for the researchers
(both young and veteran) to easily follow along with their domain of
fast-paced research and eliminate the need to manually update the
domain-specific ontologies for fields, methods and other metadata as new
research innovations come up.

## Abstract

With the vast number of datasets and literature collections available for research today, it is very difficult to keep track on the use of datasets and literature articles for scientific research and discovery. Many datasets and research work using them are left undiscovered and under-utilized due to the lack of available search tools to automatically find out who worked with the data, on what research topics, using what research methods and generating what results. The Coleridge Rich Context Competition (RCC) therefore aims to build automated dataset discovery tools for analyzing and searching social science research publications. In this chapter, we describe our approach to solving the first phase of Coleridge Rich Context Competition.


## Introduction


Automated discovery from scientific research publications is an important task for analysts, researchers, and learners as they develop the scientific knowledge and use them to gain new insights. More specifically, on the tasks of discovering datasets and methods mentioned in a research publication, we have seen a lack of available tools to easily find who else worked on a particular dataset, what research methods people apply on the dataset, and what results they have found using the dataset. Furthermore, new datasets are not easy to discover, and as a result, good datasets and methods are often neglected.

The Coleridge Rich Context Competition (RCC) aims to build automated datasets discovery from social science research publications, filling the gap of this problem. In this competition, given a corpus of social science research publications, we have to automatically identify datasets used, and then infer the research methods and research fields in the publications. Note that no labeled data are given for research methods and fields identification.

We describes our submission to the first phase of RCC. We perform dataset detection followed by implicit entity linking approach to tackle dataset extraction task. We adopt weakly supervised classification for research methods and fields identification tasks utilizing external resource SAGE Knowledge as proxy for weak labels.

<!-- This manuscript describes summary of our submission for the first phase

our approach in section \[sec:methods\], and discuss our experiment

## Related Work

Extracting information from scientific text has been explored in the past [[PM04](#PM04); [NCKL15](#NCKL15); [SBP<sup>+</sup>16](#SBP+16)]. One type of information extraction from scientific articles is extracting keyphrases and relation between them [[ADR<sup>+</sup>17](#ADR+17)]. Luan et al. (2017) propose semi-supervised sequence tagging approach to extract keyphrases [[LOH17](#LOH17)]. Augenstein and Søgaard (2017) explore multi-task deep recurrent neural network approach with several auxiliary tasks to extract keyphrases [[AS17](#AS17)].

Another type of extraction is citation extraction. Two citation extraction settings have been explored before: reference mining inside the full text [[ACK18](#ACK18)], and citation metadata extraction [[Het08](#Het08); [APBM14](#APBM14); [AGJ<sup>+</sup>17](#AGJ+17)]. Nasar er al. (2018) write a survey on information extraction from scientific articles [[NJM18](#NJM18)].

Recently, there are some work to explore dataset extraction from
scientific text [[BREM12](#BREM12); [GML<sup>+</sup>16](#GML+16); [GMVL16](#GMVL16)]. Boland et al. (2012) propose weakly supervised pattern induction to identify references in social science publications [[BREM12](#BREM12)]. Ghavimi et al. (2016) propose a semi automatic approach for detecting dataset references for social science texts [[GML<sup>+</sup>16](#GML+16); [GMVL16](#GMVL16)]. Dataset extraction is a challenging task because of the inconsistency and wide range of dataset mention styles in research publications [[GMVL16](#GMVL16)].

## Data Analysis

The first phase of RCC dataset consists of a labeled corpus of 5,000 publications for training set, and additional 100 publications for development set. The RCC organizer keeps a separate corpus of 5,000 publications for evaluation. Each article in the dataset contains full text article and dataset citation labels. The metadata of cited datasets in the corpus are also provided. For research methods and fields, no label information is provided, only SAGE social science research method graph and research fields vocabulary are provided. More details on RCC dataset and competition design can be read on chapter 5.

#### Preprocessing

In order to reliably access important structures of paper publications, we parse all papers using AllenAI Science Parse ([https://github.com/allenai/science-parse](https://github.com/allenai/science-parse)) [[AGB<sup>+</sup>18](#AGB+18)]. AllenAI Science Parse reads PDF file, and returns title, authors, abstract, sections, and bibliography (references). Since this parser utilizes machine learning models to parse PDF file, the parsing results may not be 100% accurate. Furthermore, this parser is unable to parse scan copy of old publication. In the situation where we are unable to access parsed fields, we fall back to the given text files.

#### Mention Analysis

There are 5,499 and 123 dataset citations in training and development set respectively. Among these citations, 320 citations in training set and 6 citations in development set do not have mentions information. We analyze the paper sections where the dataset mentions commonly occur. Table [10.1](#user-content-tab_train_top_sections) and [10.2](#user-content-tab_dev_top_sections) show top 12 most common sections mentioning dataset in training and development set. The tables suggest that abstract, reference titles, discussion, results, and methods are the most common sections where the dataset mentions occur. We exploit reference titles for dataset extraction.

#### Citation Analysis

We build citation network from training set. Each node in the network is a paper publication, and an edge between two node <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A" title="A" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?B" title="B" /> is generated if a paper <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A" title="A" /> cites paper <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?B" title="B" />. Table [10.3](#user-content-tab_network_stats) shows the statistics of the citation network.


<a name="tab_network_stats">Table 10.3</a>: Statistics of Citation Network

| | |
--------------- | -------:
Number of nodes | 5,000
Number of edges | 1,222
Network density | 0.0098%


Initially, we propose an approach utilizing citation network based on an intuition that datasets, research methods, and research fields are shared by: 1) same or similar issues, 2) same or similar context, 3) same or similar authors and communities, 4) same or similar metrics used in the publication. However, based on table [10.3](#user-content-tab_network_stats), we learn that exploring rich context using paper-paper citation network is not viable at this stage because most papers listed in publications’ bibliography are not available in the training set, and therefore, paper-paper citation network becomes very sparse with many unknown information. Figure [10.1](#fig_citation_graph) shows the visualization of citation network. As we can see in the citation network visualization, most papers only have one edge, although the average number of papers in bibliography list is 34.5. Furthermore, only 1,466 out of 5,000 publications are not isolated (having at least one bibliography paper in training data). Due to this reason, we drop our idea on utilizing paper-paper citation network at this stage. Nevertheless, we believe that bibliography contains important signals and information about datasets, and research fields.

## Methods

In this section, we describe our approach for RCC tasks: dataset extraction, research methods identification, and research fields identification.

#### Dataset Extraction

We employ a pipeline of two subtasks for dataset extraction: dataset detection, followed by dataset recognition. The goal of dataset detection is to detect whether a publication cites a dataset or not. This first subtask helps us to quickly filter out non-dataset publications. After the first subtask, we mine dataset mentions for the remaining publications in dataset recognition subtask.

For dataset detection, we utilize paper title in bibliography (reference list) combined with explicit research methods mentions to detect whether a publication citing a dataset or not. Explicit research methods mentions are determined based on exact match between paper title and SAGE research methods vocabulary. We train an SVM classifier using explicit research method mentions and n-gram features from paper titles in bibliography. We use the SVM classifier to classify each publication, if the classifier gives positive label, then we proceed to dataset recognition subtask, otherwise we ignore the publication.

For dataset recognition, we use an implicit entity linking approach. We start with the Naive Bayes model, which can be regarded as a standard information retrieval baseline, and entity indicative weighting strategy is used to improve the model. In order to calculate the word distribution of each dataset, we represent each dataset using its title, dataset mentions (provided in the training set), and dataset relevant sentences, filtered from the relevant publications using the rule based approach proposed in [[GMVL16](#GMVL16)]. All these texts related to a particular dataset are considered as a single string, and we calculate the word distribution as follows. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$\textbf{w}$" title="$\textbf{w}$" /> be the set of words in a dataset. In our problem setting, we assume the dataset prior probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(d)" title="p(d)" /> to be uniform. The probability of dataset <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d" title="d" /> given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$$w$&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}$" title="$$w$ \in \textbf{w}$" /> is:

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f(d,&space;w)" title="f(d, w)" /> is the number of co-occurrences of word <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" /> with entity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d" title="d" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\gamma" title="\gamma" /> is the smoothing parameter, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?|W|" title="|W|" /> is the vocabulary size. For each dataset <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d" title="d" />, we derive <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f(d,&space;w)" title="f(d, w)" /> by the count of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" /> occurrences in the text extracted for each dataset. In order to stress more priority for dataset indicative words, we improved the final objective function of our model as follows:

<!-- $$ln(p(d|\textbf{w})) \propto \sum _{w \in \textbf{w}} \beta(w) * ln(p(w|d))$$ -->
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$$ln(p(d|\textbf{w}))&space;\propto&space;\sum&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\beta(w)&space;*&space;ln(p(w|d))$$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$$ln(p(d|\textbf{w}))&space;\propto&space;\sum&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\beta(w)&space;*&space;ln(p(w|d))$$" title="$$ln(p(d|\textbf{w})) \propto \sum _{w \in \textbf{w}} \beta(w) * ln(p(w|d))$$" /></a>

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta(w)" title="\beta(w)" /> is the entity-indicative weight for word <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" />. This weight <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta(w)" title="\beta(w)" /> is added as an exponent to the term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(w|d)" title="p(w|d)" />. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta(w)" title="\beta(w)" /> is calculated as:

<!-- $$\beta(w) = log(1 + E / df(w))$$ -->

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E" title="E" /> is the number of distinct datasets considered and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?df(w)" title="df(w)" /> counts the number of datasets with at least one occurrence of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" />. This model can be trained efficiently, and training the model on RCC dataset needs approximately 5 minutes.

Then for a given unseen publication, we use same rule based approach [[GMVL16](#GMVL16)] to filter a few relevant sentences, and datasets are ranked by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?ln(p(d|w))" title="ln(p(d|w))" /> to select the most suitable datasets. In order to select exact datasets related to particular publication, we select top 10 datasets ranked using above approach. And then the confidence probability related to the top 10 datasets are normalized and select the datasets with the normalized probability higher than a predefined threshold value. We return the entity indicative words as relevant dataset mentions.

#### Research Methods Identification

Since we do not have labeled training data for this task, we use explicit research method mentions (based on exact match with SAGE research methods vocabulary) in a publication as weak signals on research methods used in the publication. When these mentions frequently appear in a publication, there is a high chance that this publication is using these particular research methods.

Based on this intuition, we generate training set for research method classification utilizing sentences that explicitly mention research method in a publication. Publication title and the sentences mentioning research method serve as context information of a specific research method. In order to reduce noisy weak signals, we apply minimum support of three sentences in a publication. We exclude research methods which only being mentioned one or two times in a publication. We also exclude research methods that only being mentioned in less than 10 different publications from the training set. Finally, we have 133 research methods having sufficient context information for training data. This number is 20.18% of 659 research methods in SAGE research method graph.

We use the training data to train logistic regression classifier to classify research methods from publication title and sentences. We utilize n-gram features from publication title and sentences for the classifier. We apply the logistic regression classifier to recommend top 3 research methods based on logistic regression probability score.

This approach can be extended by utilizing research method graph to expand the context. Context information does not only comes from sentences in publication, but also comes from related research methods as well as broader concept information. By using this information, we can potentially expand to more than 133 research methods and perform more accurate prediction.

#### Research Fields Identification

Similar to research methods identification, this task does not have labeled training data. We only have access to list of SAGE research fields. SAGE research fields are organized hierarchically into three levels, namely L1, L2, and L3, for example: Soc-2-4 (*kinship*) is under Soc (*sociology*) in L1, and under Soc-2 (*anthropology*) in L2.

To gain more understanding about the characteristic of each field, we crawl top search results from SAGE Knowledge[<sup>2</sup>](http://sk.sagepub.com/browse/). From the search result snippets, we collect information such as title and abstract on various publications including case, major work, books, handbooks, and dictionary. We exclude video and encyclopedia. Due to sparseness of the SAGE Knowledge, we exclude all research fields with less than 10 search results. In the end, we have samples of 414 L3 research fields under 101 L2 research fields and 10 L1 research fields. This numbers cover 20.87% of 1,984 L3 research fields, and 67.79% of 149 L2 research fields in the list of SAGE research fields. We use this data to train research fields classifiers.

We build three SVM classifiers for L1, L2, and L3 to classify a publication using paper title and abstract. Instead of taking the highest score, we take top-k research fields and perform re-ranking considering agreement among L1, L2, L3. We return a research field if its upper level are also in top ranks. Since level L1 is too general, we only output research fields from L2, and L3. We outline our heuristic to reorder the ranking below:

1.  Get top-5 L3 research fields, top-4 L2 research fields, and top-3 L1 research fields.

2.  Assign initial score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v" title="v" /> for each research field based on its
    ranking.

    <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=v(f_i)&space;=&space;(K&space;-&space;i)&space;/&space;K" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v(f_i)&space;=&space;(K&space;-&space;i)&space;/&space;K" title="v(f_i) = (K - i) / K" /></a>

    where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?K" title="K" /> is the length of top-k, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i" title="i" /> is the ranking of a research field <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f" title="f" />. For example, research fields in top-5 L3 have initial score of `[1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]`, top-4 L2 have initial score of `[1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25]`, and top-3 L1 have `[1, 0.666, 0.333]`

3.  Update the score by multiplying each score with the score of
    matching research fields at upper level, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?0" title="0" /> otherwise.

    <!-- $$score(f_i^l) =
            \begin{cases}
            \prod _{l \in L} v(f^l) & \text{if field matched} \\
            0 & \text{otherwise}
            \end{cases}$$  -->
    <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=score(f_i^l)&space;=&space;\begin{cases}&space;\prod&space;_{l&space;\in&space;L}&space;v(f^l)&space;&&space;\text{if&space;field&space;matched}&space;\\&space;0&space;&&space;\text{otherwise}&space;\end{cases}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?score(f_i^l)&space;=&space;\begin{cases}&space;\prod&space;_{l&space;\in&space;L}&space;v(f^l)&space;&&space;\text{if&space;field&space;matched}&space;\\&space;0&space;&&space;\text{otherwise}&space;\end{cases}" title="score(f_i^l) = \begin{cases} \prod _{l \in L} v(f^l) & \text{if field matched} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}" /></a>

    where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?L" title="L" /> is the level of research field <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f" title="f" /> and
    its upper levels. Here are examples of score update:
    -   Soc-2-4 at rank-2 in L3, Soc-2 at rank-3 in L2, and Soc at
        rank-1 in L1. In this case, the score of Soc-2-4 is
        `0.8 * 0.5 * 1 = 0.4`.
    -   Soc-2-4 at rank-1 in L3, Soc-2 at rank-2 in L2, but Soc is not found in top rank in L1. In this case, the score of Soc-2-4 is `0`.
4.  Collect score from L2 and L3, and exclude L2 if we see more specific of L2 in top-5 L3.

5.  Re-rank L2 and L3 research fields based on the score.

6.  Return research fields having score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?>=&space;0.4" title=">= 0.4" />.

To expand to more context from paper list in bibliography section, we also build other three Naive Bayes classifiers for L1, L2, and L3 using paper title feature only. We believe that a publication from a certain field also cites other publications from same or similar fields. For each publication in the bibliography, we apply the same procedure as mentioned above, then we average the score to get top research fields from bibliography. Finally, we combine top research fields from paper titles and abstract with results from bibliography.


## Experiment Results


We discuss our experiment results for each task in this section. We use standard precision, recall, and F1 as evaluation metrics.

#### Dataset Extraction

First, we analyze our experiment for dataset detection subtask comparing Naive Bayes and SVM classifier. Using only paper titles in bibliography and explicit research method mentions, Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers are able to reach 0.88 & 0.92 F1 score respectively. Since SVM outperforms Naive Bayes, we use SVM for our dataset detection module. Table [10.4](#user-content-tab_dd_dev_result) shows detail dataset detection results on development set.

<a name="tab_dd_dev_result">Table 10.4</a>: Dataset Detection Results on Development Set

Classifier | Prec. | Rec. | F1
---------- | ----: | ---: | ---:
Naive Bayes | 0.85 | 0.92 | 0.88
SVM | 0.96 | 0.88 | 0.92

To see the impact of performing dataset detection, we test the performance of dataset extraction with and without dataset detection on development set. Table [10.5](#user-content-tab_de_dev_result) summarizes the results. As shown in the table, performing dataset detection before extraction significantly improves the dataset extraction on development set.

<a name="tab_de_dev_result">Table 10.5</a>: Dataset Extraction Results on Development Set

Method | Prec. | Rec. | F1
------ | ----: | ---: | ---:
No Dataset Detection | 0.18 | 0.33 | 0.24
With Dataset Detection | 0.34 | 0.30 | 0.32

<a name="tab_de_test_result">Table 10.6</a>: Dataset Extraction Result on Test Set

Dataset | Prec. | Rec. | F1
------- | ----: | ---: | ---:
Test Set (phase1) | 0.17 | 0.10 | 0.13

Table [10.6](#user-content-tab_de_test_result) shows dataset extraction performance on test set (phase 1). The significant drop from development set result suggests that the test set might have different distribution compare to the training and development set. It might also contain dataset citations that are never been seen in training set. As mentioned in chapter 5, the test set contains new data source, non-open access journals from Sage publications which are not available in training and development set. It would be better to evaluate open access publications and non-open access publications separately so that we can have better understanding on the characteristics on each source in test set.

#### Research Methods Identification

We only consider Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers for research method identification because they naturally outputs probability score. We perform 5-fold cross validation to evaluate classification performance, and the result can be seen in table [10.7](#user-content-tab_rmethods_5cv). Logistic regression classifier outperforms Naive Bayes with 0.86 F1 score in classifying 133 research methods.

<a name="tab_rmethods_5cv">Table 10.7</a>: F1 Score for Research Method Classification

Classifier | F1
---------- | ---:
Naive Bayes | 0.55
Logistic Regression | 0.86

#### Research Fields Identification

We perform 5-fold cross validation to evaluate our classifiers to classify L1, L2, and L3 research fields. Table [10.8](#user-content-tab_rfields_pub_5cv) shows the results using n-gram features from paper title and abstract, whereas table [10.9](#user-content-tab_rfields_rt_5cv) shows the results using n-gram features from title only. Naive Bayes tends to perform slightly better on L3 research fields where we have large number of research field labels. We decide to use SVM for research field identification on publication level because SVM is generally better than Naive Bayes. On the other hand, we decide to use Naive Bayes for research field identification on bibliography level because Naive Bayes prefer to have more accurate L2 and L3 research fields.

<a name="tab_rfields_pub_5cv">Table 10.8</a>: F1 Score for Research Field Classification on Publication Level using Paper Title and Abstract

Classifier | L1 | L2 | L3
---------- | ----: | ---: | ---:
Naive Bayes | 0.78 | 0.37 | 0.13
SVM | 0.82 | 0.38 | 0.12

<a name="tab_rfields_rt_5cv">Table 10.9</a>: F1 Score for Research Field Classification on Bibliography Level using Paper Title Only

Classifier | L1 | L2 | L3
---------- | ----: | ---: | ---:
Naive Bayes | 0.80 | 0.35 | 0.12
SVM | 0.81 | 0.35 | 0.11


## Lesson Learned

Extraction of research datasets, associated research methods and fields from social science publication is challenging, yet an important problem to organize social science publications. We have described our approach for the RCC challenge, and table [10.10](#user-content-tab_summary) summarizes our approach. Beside publication content such as paper titles, abstract, full text, our approach also leverages on the information from bibliography. Furthermore, we also collect external information from SAGE Knowledge to get more information about research fields.

<a name="tab_summary">Table 10.10</a>: Summary of Our Approach

Method | Features (n-gram)
------ | -----------------
**Dataset extraction** ||
SVM for dataset detection | paper titles in bibliography and explicit research method mentions
Implicit entity linking | paper title and full text
**Research method identification** ||
Logistic regression | paper title, abstract, and full text
**Research field identification** ||
SVM (on paper) | paper title and abstract
Naive Bayes (on bibliography) | paper titles in bibliography

Apart from F1 score on 5-fold cross validation, we have no good way to evaluate research method and research field identification without ground truth label. Our methods are unable to automatically extract and recognize new datasets, research methods, and fields. An extension to automatically handle such cases using advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach is a promising future direction. All RCC finalists have shown that NLP approaches worked well on dataset extraction. Readers are encouraged to read their solutions on chapter 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Our model did not perform well in test set, and unable to advance to the second phase. Nevertheles, we recommend to use our approach as a baseline method as it is simple, efficient, and fast to train. From this competition, we have learned that lacks of labelled training data is a huge challenge, and it directs us to other external resources (i.e., SAGE Knowledge) as proxy for our label. We are also interested in exploring more advanced information extraction approaches on the RCC datasets. Another challenge is data sparsity. Although we see many papers listed in bibliography, lacks of access to these publication make us difficult to exploit citation network. Expanding labeled data from the list of papers in bibliography will be very beneficial to improve rich context of paper publications and datasets.

Abstract
========

Datasets are critical for scientific research, playing a role in
replication, reproducibility, and efficiency. Researchers have recently
shown that datasets are becoming more important for science to function
properly, even serving as artifacts of study themselves. However, citing
datasets is not a common or standard practice in spite of recent efforts
by data repositories and funding agencies. This greatly affects our
ability to track their usage and importance. A potential solution to
this problem is to automatically extract dataset mentions from
scientific articles. In this work, we propose to achieve such extraction
by using a neural network based on a BiLSTM-CRF architecture. Our method
achieves $F_{1}=0.885$ in social science articles released as part of
the Rich Context Dataset. We discuss future improvements to the model
and applications beyond social sciences.


Introduction
============

Science is fundamentally an incremental discipline that depends on
previous scientist's work. Datasets form an integral part of this
process and therefore should be shared and cited as any other scientific
output. This ideal is far from reality: the credit that datasets
currently receive does not correspond to their actual usage[@datarank].
One of the issues is that there is no standard for citing datasets, and
even if they are cited, they are not properly tracked by major
scientific indices. Interestingly, while datasets are still used and
mentioned in articles, we lack methods to extract such mentions and
properly reconstruct dataset citations. The Rich Context Competition
challenge aims at closing this gap by inviting scientists to produce
automated dataset mention and linkage detection algorithms. In this
article, we detail our proposal to solve the dataset mention step. Our
approach attempts to provide a first approximation to better give credit
and keep track of datasets and their usage.

The problem of dataset extraction has been explored before.
@ghavimiIdentifyingImprovingDataset2016 and
@ghavimiSemiautomaticApproachDetecting2017 use a relatively simple
tf-idf representation with cosine similarity for matching dataset
identification in social science articles. Their method consists of four
major steps: preparing a curated dictionary of typical mention phrases,
detecting dataset references, and ranking matching datasets based on
cosine similarity of tf-idf representations. This approach achieved a
relatively high performance, with $F_{1}=0.84$ for mention detection and
$F_{1}=0.83$, for matching. @singhalDataExtractMining2013 proposed a
method using normalized Google distance to screen whether a term is in a
dataset. However, this method relies on external services and is not
computational efficient. They achieve a good $F_{1}=0.85$ using Google
search and $F_{1}=0.75$ using Bing. A somewhat similar project was
proposed by @luDatasetSearchEngine2012. They built a dataset search
engine by solving the two challenges: identification of the dataset and
association to a URL. They build a dataset of 1000 documents with their
URLs, containing 8922 words or abbreviations representing datasets. They
also build a web-based interface. This shows the importance of dataset
mention extraction and how several groups have tried to tackle the
problem.

In this article, we describe a method for extracting dataset mentions
based on a deep recurrent neural network. In particular, we used a
Bidirectional Long short-term Memory (BiLSTM) sequence to sequence model
paired with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) inference mechanism. The
architecture is similar to chapter 6, but we only focus on the detection
of dataset mentions. We tested our model on a novel dataset produced for
the Rich Context Competition challenge. We achieve a relatively good
performance of $F_{1}=0.885$. We discuss the limitations of our model.

The dataset
===========

The Rich Context Dataset challenge was proposed by the New York
University's Coleridge Initiative [@richtextcompetition]. The challenge
comprised several phases, and participants moved through the phases
depending on their performance. We only analyze data of the first phase.
This phase contained a list of datasets and a labeled corpus of around
5K publications. Each publication was labeled indicating whether a
dataset was mentioned within it and which part of the text mentioned it.
The challenge used the accuracy for measuring the performance of the
competitors and also the quality of the code, documentation, and
efficiency.


We adopt the CoNLL 2003 format [@tjong2003introduction] to annotate
whether a token is a part of dataset mention. Concretely, we use the tag
DS denotes a dataset mention; The B- prefix indicates that the token is
the beginning of a dataset mention, the I- prefix indicates the token is
inside of dataset mention, and O denotes a token that is not a part of
dataset mention. We put each token and its tag (separated by horizontal
tab control character) in one line, and use the end of line (\\n)
control character as separator between sentences (see Table 2.1). The dataset were randomly split by
70%, 15%, 15% for training set, validation set and testing set,
respectively.

  tagging format.

The Proposed Method
===================

Overall view of the architecture
--------------------------------

In this section, we propose a model for detecting mentions based on a
BiLSTM-CRF architecture. At a high level, the model uses a
sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network that produces the
probability of whether a token belongs to a dataset mention. The CRF
layer takes those probabilities and estimates the most likely sequence
based on constrains between label transitions (e.g.,
mention--to--no-mention--to-mention has low probability). While this is
a standard architecture for modeling sequence labeling, the application
to our particular dataset and problem is new.

We now describe in more detail the choices of word representation,
hyper-parameters, and training parameters. A schematic view of the model
is in Figure 3.1 and the components are as follows:

1.  Character encoder layer: treat a token as a sequence of characters
    and encode the characters by using a bidirectional LSTM to get a
    vector representation.

2.  Word embedding layer: mapping each token into fixed sized vector
    representation by using a pre-trained word vector.

3.  BiLSTM layer: make use of Bidirectional LSTM network to capture the
    high level representation of the whole token sequence input.

4.  Dense layer: project the output of the previous layer to a low
    dimensional vector representation of the the distribution of labels.

5.  CRF layer: find the most likely sequence of labels.

Character encoder
-----------------

Similar to the bag of words assumption, a word could be composed of
characters sampled from a bag of characters. Previous research
[@santos2014learning; @jozefowicz2016exploring] has shown that the use
of character-level embedding could benefit multiple NLP-related tasks.
In order to use character-level information, we break down a word into a
sequence of characters, then build a vocabulary of characters. We
initialize the character embedding weights using the vocabulary size of
a pre-defined embedding dimension, then update the weights during the
training process to get the fixed-size character embedding. Next, we
feed a sequence of the character embedding into an encoder (a
bidirectional LSTM network) to produce a vector representation of a
word. By using a character encoder, we can solve the out-of-vocabulary
problem for pre-trained word embedding, as every word could be composed
of characters.

Word Embedding
--------------

The word embedding layer is responsible for storing and retrieving the
vector representation of words. Concretely, the word embedding layer
contains a word embedding matrix $M^{tkn}\in\mathbb{R}^{|V|d}$, where
the $V$ is the vocabulary of the tokens and the $d$ is the size of the
embedding vector. The embedding matrix was initialized by a pre-trained
GloVe vectors [@pennington2014glove], and updated by learning from the
data. In order to retrieve from the embedding matrix, we first convert a
given sentence into a sequence of tokens, then for each token we lookup
the embedding matrix to get its vector representation. Finally, we get a
sequence of vectors as input for the encoder layer.

LSTM
----

The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural
network which takes the output of previous step as input of the current
step recurrently. This recurrent nature allows it to learn from
sequential data, for example, the text which consists of a sequence of
works. RNN could capture contextual information in variable-length
sequences in theory but it suffers from gradient exploding/vanishing
problems [@pascanu2013difficulty]. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
architecture was proposed by @hochreiter1997long to cope with these
gradient problems. Similar to standard RNN, the LSTM network also has a
repeating module called LSTM cell. The cell remembers information over
arbitrary time steps because it allows information to flow along it
without change. The cell state is regulated by a forget gate and an
input gate which control the proportion of information to forget from a
previous time step and to remember for a next time step. Also, there is
a output gate controlling the information to flow out of the cell. The
LSTM could be defined formally by the following equations:

$$i_{t}=\sigma(W_{i}x_{t}+W_{i}h_{t-1}+b_{i})$$

$$f_{t}=\sigma(W_{f}x_{t}+W_{f}h_{t-1}+b_{f})$$

$$g_{t}=tanh(W_{g}x_{t}+W_{g}h_{t-1}+b_{g})$$

$$o_{t}=\sigma(W_{o}x_{t}+W_{o}h_{t-1}+b_{o})$$

$$c_{t}=f_{t}\bigotimes c_{t-1}+i_{t}\bigotimes g_{t}$$

$$h_{t}=o_{t}\bigotimes tanh(c_{t})$$

where $x_{t}$ is the input at time
$t$, $W$ is the weights, $b$ is the bias. The $\sigma$ is the sigmoid
function, $\bigotimes$ denotes the dot product, $c_{t}$ is the LSTM cell
state at time $t$ and $h_{t}$ is hidden state at time $t$. The $i_{t}$,
$f_{t}$, $o_{t}$ and $g_{t}$ are named as input, forget, output and cell
gates respectively.

LSTM can learn from the previous steps, which is the left context if we
feed the sequence from left to right. However, the information in the
right context is also important for some tasks. The bidirectional LSTM
[@graves2013speech] satisfies this information need by using two LSTMs.
Concretely, one LSTM layer was fed by a forward sequence and the other
by a backward sequence. The final hidden states of each LSTM were
concatenated to model the left and right contexts

$$h_{t}=[\overrightarrow{h_{t}}\varoplus\overleftarrow{h_{t}}]$$

Finally, the outcomes of the states are taken by a Conditional Random
Field (CRF) layer that takes into account the transition nature of the
beginning, intermediate, and ends of mentions. For a reference of CRF,
refer to [@lafferty2001conditional]

Results
=======

In this work, we wanted to propose a model for the Rich Context
Competition challenge. We propose a relatively standard architecture
based on a BiLSTM-CRF recurrent neural network. We now describe the
evaluation metrics, hyper-parameter setting, and the results of this
network on the dataset provided by the competition.

For all of our results, we use $F_{1}$ as the measure of performance.
This measure is the harmonic average of the precision and recall and it
is the standard measure used in sequence labeling tasks. This metric
varies from 0 to 1, the higher the better. Our method achieved a
relatively high $F_{1}$ of 0.885 for detecting mentions.

We train models using the training data and monitor the performance
using the validation data (we stop training if the performance does not
improve for the last 10 epochs). We are using the Adam optimizer with
learning rate of 0.001 and batch size equal to 64. The hidden size of
LSTM for character and word embedding is 80 and 300, respectively. For
the regularization methods, and to avoid over-fitting, we use L2
regularization set to 0.01 and we also use dropout rate equal to 0.5. We
trained 8 models with a combination of different GloVe vector size (50,
100, 300 and 300) and dropout rate (0.0, 0.5). The hyper-parameter
settings are present in Table 4.1.

Table 4.2. Performance of proposed network

| m8     | 300        | 0.5          | 0.876     | 0.878  | 0.877 |


The test performances are reported in Table 4.2. The best model is trained by
word vector size 100 and dropout rate 0.5 with $F_{1}$ score 0.885
(Table 4.2), and it takes 15 hours 58
minutes for the training on an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU in a computer with
an Intel Xeon E5-1650v4 3.6 GHz CPU with 128 GB of RAM.

We also found some limitations to the dataset. Firstly, we found that
mentions are nested (e.g. HRS, RAND HRS, RAND HRS DATA are linked to the
same dataset). The second issue most of the mentions have ambiguous
relationships to datasets. In particular, only 17,267 (16.99%) mentions
are linked to one dataset, 15,292 (15.04%) mentions are listed to two
datasets, and 12,624 (12.42%) are linked to three datasets. If these
difficulties are not overcome, then the predictions from the linkage
process will be noisy and therefore impossible to tell apart.

Conclusion
==========

In this work, we report a high accuracy model for the problem of
detecting dataset mentions. Because our method is based on a standard
BiLSTM-CRF architecture, we expect that updating our model with recent
developments in neural networks would only benefit our results. We also
provide some evidence of how difficult we believe the linkage step of
the challenge could be if the dataset noise are not lowered.

One of the shortcomings of our approach is that the architecture is
lacking some modern features of RNN networks. In particular, recent work
has shown that attention mechanisms are important especially when the
task requires spatially distant information, such as this one. These
benefits could also translate to better linkage. We are exploring new
architectures using self-attention and multiple-head attention. We hope
to explore these approaches in the near future.

There are number of improvements that we can make in the future. A first
improvement is to use non-recurrent neural architectures such as the
Transformer which has shown to be faster and a more effective learner
compared to recurrent neural networks. Another improvement would be to
bootstrap information from other dataset sources such as open access
full-text articles from PubMed Open Access Subset. This dataset contains
dataset *citations* [@datarank]---in contrast to the most common types
of citations to publications. The location of this citations within the
full-text could be exploited to perform entity recognition. While this
would be a somewhat different problem than the one solved in this
article, it would still be useful for the goal of tracking dataset
usage. In sum, by improving the learning techniques and the dataset size
and quality, we could significantly increase the success of finding
datasets in publications.

Our proposal, however, is surprisingly effective. Because we have barely
modified a general RNN architecture, we expect that our results will
generalize relatively well either to the second phase of the challenge
or even to other disciplines. We would emphasize, however, that the
quality of the dataset has a great deal of room for improvement. Given
how important this task is for the whole of science, we should try to
strive to improve the quality of these datasets so that techniques like
this one can be more broadly applied. The importance of dataset mention
and linkage therefore could be fully appreciated by the community.

# Chapter 12 - The future of context

# The Future of AI in Rich Context

**Paco Nathan**

The setting for Rich Context originated in needs to analyze confidential micro-data for [evidence-based policymaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_for_Evidence-Based_Policymaking_Act).
The nature of that work involves collaboration using [_linked data_](http://linkeddata.org/), with strict requirements for data privacy and security, plus provisions for data stewardship and dataset curation.
Due to the highly regulated environments, that data cannot be examined outside of its specific use cases.
In a world where public search engines crawl and index millions of terabytes, making search results available within milliseconds to anyone with a browser and an Internet connection, the setting for Rich Context may appear utterly alien.
Seemingly, a reasonable compromise would be to run queries of sensistive data within their secure environments, and otherwise leave the process unexamined.

However, there’s a broader scope to consider, far beyond the process of managing research projects or curating particular datasets.
The great challenges of our time are human in nature – climate change, terrorism, overuse of natural resources, the nature of work, and so on – and these require robust social science to understand their causes and consequences.
Effective use of data for social science research depends on understanding how datasets have been produced and how they’ve been used in previous works.
That understanding of data provenance is complicated by the fact that research often must link datasets from different data producers, different agencies, different organizations.

Other factors confound this situation.
On the one hand, the availability of inexpensive computing resources, ubiquitous connected mobile devices, social networks with global reach, etc., implies that researchers can acquire large, rich datasets.
Researchers can also fit statistical models that might have seemed intractably complex merely a decade ago.
On the other hand, accumulating important information about datasets, their provenance, and their usage has historically been a manual process.
Sharing this kind of information across organizations is difficult in general, and when datasets include confidential data about human subjects it becomes impossible to provide open access to the original data.
These issues combine to contribute to a lack of reproducibility and replicability in the study of human behavior, and threaten the legitimacy and utility of social science research.

The problems enumerated above make it difficult for people to understand about data usage, although at the same time they present opportunities for leveraging automation.
Consider how one of the major challenges in social science research is search and discovery: the vast majority of data and research results cannot be easily discovered by other researchers.
From one perspective, researchers are the users of micro data and its related [_metadata_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) – in other words, information about the structure of datasets, their provenance, etc. – and those researchers produce outcomes, often in the form of publications.
Publications accumulate expertise and nuances about datasets, including the data preparation required, research topics and methodology, what kinds of analyses were attempted and ultimately used, which information within the datasets was most valuable for the results obtained, and so on.
These details produced through publications represent _metadata about datasets_.
While the metadata within publications may be relatively unstructured – i.e., not explicitly articulated, nor shared outside of the current project – advances in machine learning provide means to extract metadata from unstructured sources.

The exchange of metadata plays another important role.
From the perspective of a data publisher (i.e., an agency) the many concerns about security and data privacy indicate use of _tiered access_ for sensitive data.
Datasets which do not contain sensitive data may be made freely available to the public as [_open data_](https://www.data.gov/).
Other datasets may require DUAs before researchers can access them.
So the data sharing may need to be organized in tiers.
Nonetheless, metadata for the private tiers in many cases may still be shared even though the data cannot be linked directly without explicit authorizations and stewardship.
So metadata provides a role of exchanging information about sensitive data, in ways that can be accumulated across a broader scope than individual research projects.

The opportunity at hand is to leverage machine learning advances to create feedback loops among the entities involved: researchers, datasets, data publishers, publications, and so on.
A new generation of tooling for search and discovery could leverage that to augment researchers: informing them about what datasets are being used, in which research fields, the tools involved, as well as the methods used and findings from the research.


## The Case for Rich Context

Consider the two most fundamental workflows within Rich Context, where analysts and other researchers interact among data providers, data stewards, training programs, security audits, etc.:

 -  **Collaboration and Workspace:** where researchers collaborate within a secured environment, having obtained authorizations via NDAs (non-disclosure agreements), DUAs (data use authorizations), etc.
 -  **Data Stewardship:** where data stewards can review and determine whether to approve requests for using the datasets that they curate, and then monitor and report on subsequent usage.

These components represent _explicitly_ linked feedback loops among the researchers, projects, datasets, and data stewards.
Researchers also use other _implicitly_ linked feedback loops externally to draw from published social science research.
Overall, the general category of linked data describes these interactions.

A large body of AI applications leverages linked data.
Related R&D efforts have focused mostly on public search engines, e-commerce platforms, and research in life sciences – while in social science research the use of this technology is relatively uncharted territory.
Also, given the security and compliance requirements involved with sensitive data, the process of leveraging linked data in social science research takes on nuanced considerations and compels novel solutions.

This area of focus represents the core of Rich Context: the interconnection of point solutions that facilitate research, as explicit feedback loops, along with means to leverage the implicit feedback loops that draw from published research.
Making use of AI applications to augment social science research is the goal of Rich Context work, and that interconnection of feedback loops, through a graph, creates a kind of _virtuous cycle_ for metadata – analogous to the famous [virtuous cycle of data](https://youtu.be/21EiKfQYZXc) required for AI applications in industry, as described Andrew Ng.

In general, guidance for Rich Context can be drawn from the FAIR[^1] data principles for data management and data stewardship in science.
The FAIR acronym stands for _Findable_, _Accessible_, _Interoperable_, and _Reusable_ data, addressing the issue of reproducibility in scientific research.
One observation from the original FAIR paper describes core tenets of Rich Context:

> Humans, however, are not the only critical stakeholders in the milieu of scientific data. Similar problems are encountered by the applications and computational agents that we task to undertake data retrieval and analysis on our behalf. These ‘computational stakeholders’ are increasingly relevant, and demand as much, or more, attention as their importance grows. One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science, therefore, is to improve knowledge discovery through assisting both humans, and their computational agents, in the discovery of, access to, and integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and other scholarly digital objects.

In other words, throughout the use cases for scientific data there are substantial opportunities for human-in-the-loop AI approaches, where the people involved increasingly have their work augmented by automated means, while the automation involved increasingly gets improved by incorporating human expertise.
One can use the metaphor of a _graph_ to represent the linkages: those that span across distinct research projects, those that require cross-agency collaboration with sensitive data, and those that integrate workflows beyond the scope of specific tools.
Specifically, this work entails the development of a [_knowledge graph_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) to represent metadata about datasets, researchers, projects, agencies, etc., – including the computational agents involved – as distinct entities connected through relations that model their linkage.

![example graph relations](combined_images/illo.2.png "example graph relations")

Much of the intelligence in this kind of system is based on leveraging inference across the graph, insights which could not be inferred within the scope of a single research project or through the use of one particular tool.
Over time, the process accumulates a richer context of relations into that graph while clarifying and leveraging the feedback loops among the entities within the graph.
Rich Context establishes foundations for that work in social science research.

The [Rich Context Competition](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition#problemdescription) held during September 2018 through February 2019 invited AI research teams to compete in one aspect of Rich Context requirements.
Several teams submitted solutions to automate the discovery of research datasets along with associated research methods and fields, as identified in social science research publications.
Methods for machine learning and text analytics used by the four finalist teams provided complementary approaches, all focused on the problem of [_entity linking_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking), with a corpus of social science research papers used as their training data.

The results of the competition provided metadata to describe links among datasets used in social science research. In other words, the outcome of the competition generated the basis for a moderately-sized knowledge graph.
There are many publication sources to analyze, and the project will pursue that work as an ongoing process to extract the implied metadata.
Meanwhile the increasing adoption and usage of the ADRF framework continues to accumulate metadata directly.


## Use Cases for Rich Context

Looking at potential use cases for Rich Context more formally, we can identify needs for leveraging a knowledge graph about research datasets and related entities.
For each of these needs, we can associate solutions based on open source software which have well-known use cases in industry.

As an example, consider a dataset _A001_ published by a data provider _XYZ Agency_ where _Jane Smith_ works as the data steward responsible for curating that dataset.
Over time, multiple research projects describe the use of _A001_ in their published results.
Some researchers note, on the one hand, that particular columns in data tables within _A001_ have some troubling data quality issues – inconsistent names and acronyms, identifiers that require transformations before they can be used to join with other datasets, and so on.
On the other hand, the body of research related to _A001_ illustrates how it gets joined frequently with another dataset _B023_ to support analysis using a particular research method.
The two datasets provide more benefits when used together.

While access to the _A001_ dataset gets managed through the _XYZ Agency_ and its use of the ADRF framework, other datasets such as _B023_ get used outside of that context.
A knowledge graph is used to accumulate information about the datasets, research projects, the resulting published papers, etc., and applications for augmenting research derive quite directly from that graph.
For example, feedback from researchers about how _A001_ gets combined with other datasets outside of the _XYZ Agency_ domain help guide _Jane Smith_ to resolve some of the data quality issues.
New columns get added with cleaner data for identifiers, which allows more effective linking.
Other feedback based on machine learning models that have classified published papers then helps recommend research methods and candidate datasets to new analysts – and also to agencies that have adjacent needs, but did not previously have visibility into the datasets published by _XYZ Agency_.

These are the kinds of applications that become enabled through Rich Context.
Search and discovery is clearly a need, although other use cases can help improve the discovery process and enhance social science research.
The following sections discuss specific use cases and their high-level requirements for the associated technologies.


### Search and Discovery

As described above, the vast majority of social science data and research results cannot be easily discovered by other researchers.
While public search engines based on keyword search have been popularized by e-commerce platforms such as Google and Bing, the more general problem of search and discovery can be understood best as a graph problem, and the needs in social science research are more formally understood as recommendations across a graph.

For example, starting with a given dataset, who else has worked with that data?
Which topics did they research?
Which methods did they use?
What were their results?
In other words, starting from one entity in a knowledge graph, what other neighboring entities are linked?

These kinds of capabilities may be implemented simply by users traversing directly through the links of the graph.
However, at scale, that volume of information can become tedious and overwhelming.
It’s generally more effective for user experience (UX) to have machine learning models summarize, then predict a set of the most likely paths through the graph from a particular starting point.

One good approach for this is the general case of _link prediction_[^2]: given a researcher starting with a particular dataset and goals for topics or methods, represent that as a local, smaller graph.
Then use link prediction to fill-in missing entities and relations, extending the local graph for that researcher.
In other words, what other datasets should be joined, how can particular fields be used, what research topics or methods are related, which published papers might become foundations for this work?
The most likely links inferred become top recommendations.
Also, this kind of recommendation is not limited to the start of projects, it can be leveraged at almost any stage of research.

### Entity Linking

The Rich Context Competition demonstrated how entities and relations used to construct a knowledge graph can be mined from a corpus of scientific papers.
Machine learning methods for _entity linking_[^3] used in the competition need to be generalized and extended, then used to analyze the ongoing stream of published social science research.
This work provides potential benefits for the publishers, for example helping them analyze and annotate newly published papers, developing dashboards about data impact metrics for journals or authors, and so on.

An additional benefit of entity linking is to help correct abbreviations, localized acronyms, or mistakes in linked data references.
This is an iterative process which will need integration and feedback with data stewardship workflows.


### Classifiers

As any researcher or librarian knows well, curating a large set of research papers by hand is labor-intensive and prone to errors.
Machine learning models based on _supervised learning_ or _semi-supervised learning_ (human-in-the-loop) can produce classifiers that annotate research papers automatically.

At some point, the ADRF framework may run classifiers on the workflows (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) for projects in progress.
By extension, classifiers may infer across the knowledge graph to add annotations for datasets as well.
This work can be considered a subset of link prediction, also related to entity linking.

### Transitive Inference

The metadata collected through the use of the ADRF framework or extracted from research publications includes relations that link entities in the graph.
Once a graph is constructed, additional relations may be inferred.
This is a case of [_transitive inference_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation), which can help add useful annotations to the graph, as shown in the following diagram:

![transitive relations](combined_images/illo.3.png "transitive relations")

In an example from Norse mythology, Torunn is the daughter of Thor, and Thor is the son of Gaea, therefore Torun is the _granddaughter_ of Gaea.
The same process can apply, for example, to relations that describe links between datasets and researchers.

Note that embeddings have proven to be a powerful approach for inference about patterns, based on deep learning.
On the current forefront of AI research, methods that leverage _reinforcement learning_[^4] are positioned to outperform embeddings soon, since they explore/exploit the graph structure instead of relying on a history of observed patterns.
This is especially useful for _knowledge graph completion_, where there are cases of incomplete metadata in the knowledge graph, which is essential for Rich Context work.

### Iterative Improvement of the Knowledge Graph

Most of the finalist teams in the Rich Context Competition made use of other existing graphs to bootstrap their machine learning development work, such as the [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/reference-data-schema), [Semantic Scholar](http://api.semanticscholar.org/corpus/), and others purpose-built for the competition.
Those teams cited how some graph would need to be extended in the future, to improve recognition accuracy.

Rich Context now subsumes that effort, making the iterative improvement of the knowledge graph an ongoing priority.
In lieu of those other graphs used for bootstrap purposes during the competition, the Rich Context knowledge graph provides the foundation for machine learning.

This process of accreting more entities into the graph and refining their relations leads to better training data and improved machine learning models.
Over time, as our models improve, the previously analyzed research papers can be re-evaluated to extract richer results.
That work in turn enhances social science research within the ADRF framework, along with data curation.
That overall dynamic represents the virtuous cycle of metadata, which continually improves Rich Context.

### Axioms for Dataset Curation

Another immediate use of Rich Context is to assist the data stewards to understand the broader scope of usage for the datasets that they curate.
For example, ontology _axioms_ used on the metadata in the graph can help analyze:

 - consistency checks for the incoming metadata
 - which data stewardship rules apply in a given case

In a way, that helps codify what would otherwise be “institutional lore” – instead that's now captured for others to study, use for training new staff, etc.

Note that the ADRF framework must provide means for customizing and configuring these kinds of axioms, so that data stewardship rules rules are not tightly coupled with the security audits and release cycle.
Those rules can change rapidly, depending on new legislation or other policy updates, or even due to different agency environments.


## Leveraging Open Standards and Open Source

Overall, the Rich Context portion of the ARDF framework represents a _data catalog_ along with associated _data governance_ practices.
As a first step in knowledge graph work, we can make use of existing open standards for metadata about data catalogs and datasets.
For example, the [W3C Data Activity](https://www.w3.org/2013/data/) coordinates a wide range of metadata standards, including:

- [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) – metadata about data catalogs
- [VoID](https://www.w3.org/TR/void/#dataset) – metadata about datasets
- [DCMI](http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) – Dublin Core metadata terms
- [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-skos-core-guide/) – “simple knowledge organization system”

These represent [controlled vocabularies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary) described in [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) and based atop [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).
These standards can be combined and extended to suit the needs of specific use cases, such as within the ADRF framework.
In particular, the Rich Context knowledge graph is a superset of a [_DCAT-compliant data catalog_](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#conformance).
Taken together, localized extensions of these open standards represent an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) – essentially as a specification for defining metadata that can be added into the knowledge graph and how that graph should be structured.
Development of that ontology along with example metadata plus Python code to validate the graph is managed in the public repository [adrf-onto](https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/adrf-onto/wiki) on GitHub.

The workflows within the ADRF framework represent use cases of data governance, and there is substantial overlap between Rich Context and emerging trends for data governance in industry.
There are open source projects which leverage knowledge graphs to collect metadata about datasets and their usage, where machine learning helps address the complexities[^5] of data governance in industry data science work.
For instance:

- [Amundsen](https://eng.lyft.com/amundsen-lyfts-data-discovery-metadata-engine-62d27254fbb9) from Lyft
- [Marquez](https://marquezproject.github.io/marquez/) from WeWork
- [WhereHows](https://github.com/linkedin/WhereHows) from LinkedIn
- [Databook](https://eng.uber.com/databook/) from Uber (pending release as open source)

Of course the Rich Context work addresses special considerations for sensitive data and compliance requirements.
Even so, much can be learned from these related open source projects in industry, which are pursuing similar kinds of use cases.
[TopQuadrant](https://www.topquadrant.com/) and [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/) are examples of commercial vendors which construct knowledge graphs about datasets, also for data governance purposes – respectively in the Finance and Pharma business verticals.
These commercial solutions similarly make use of DCAT, VoID, DMCI, SKOS, and also the FAIR data principles.

In general, the subject of metadata exchange for data governance use cases is addressed by the [ODPi](https://www.odpi.org/) open standard [Egeria](https://www.odpi.org/projects/egeria) and related work by Mandy Chessell[^6], et al., including the [Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org/) open source project.
Much of that work focuses on standards used to validate the exchange of metadata reliably across different frameworks.
This implies potential opportunities for Rich Context to interoperate with other data governance solutions or related metadata services.

To help establish open standards and open source implementations related to Rich Context, the ADRF team has collaborated with [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).
A new Rich Context feature set is being added to [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is one of the key open source projects used in the architecture of the ADRF framework, and these new features will be integrated into its future releases.
The new Rich Context features support projects as top-level entities, real-time collaboration and commenting, data registry, metadata handling, annotations, and usage tracking – as described in the Project Jupyter “press release” requests for comments: [data explorer](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-data-explorer/blob/master/press_release.md), [metadata explorer](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-metadata-service/blob/master/press_release.md), and [commenting](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-commenting/blob/master/press_release.md).
For example, a team of social science researchers working on a project could use the commenting feature in Jupyter to make an annotation about data quality issues encountered in a particular dataset.
That comment, as metadata about the dataset, would get imported into the knowledge graph, and could later be used for recommendations to a data steward or other researchers.

Note that most of the machine learning approaches referenced above are specific cases of [_deep learning_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), based on layered structures of artificial neural networks. In particular, _graph embedding_[^7] is an approach that vectorizes portions of graphs to use as training data for deep learning models.
Graph embedding can be used to perform entity linking, link prediction, etc.
In many of these cases, the resulting machine learning models become proxies for the graph data, such that the entire knowledge graph data is not required in production use cases.
That practice contrasts earlier and generally less effective approaches which relied on graph queries applied to the full data.
Note that the [winning team](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/an-interview-with-the-allen-institute-for-artificial-intelligence) in the Rich Context Competition was from [Allen AI](https://allenai.org/) which is a leader in the field of using embedded models for natural language.
Typical open source frameworks which are popular for deep learning research include [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (from Facebook) and the more recent [Ray](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributed_training.html) (from UC Berkeley RISElab).


## System Architecture Overview

The following diagram illustrates a proposed system architecture for Rich Context as an additional module in the ADRF framework:

![Rich Context module](combined_images/illo.4.png "Rich Context module")

Building on the DFCore features plus the Data Stewardship module, Rich Context provides both a destination for metadata (logging events from components, or extracted metadata from analysis of publications) and a source for metadata ontology used in the ADRF framework.
Machine learning models get trained and updated based on the knowledge graph, then used for services (recommender system, classifiers, etc.) provided back into the ADRF framework, and additionally to support training initiatives – or for general purpose search and discovery by researchers.

The additional system components for implementing Rich Context are based primarily on open source software (e.g., PyTorch) and extensions of open standards (e.g., W3C), all within the security context of AWS GovCloud implementation of the ADRF framework.


## Trends, from origins to near-term future projections

Meanwhile, the development of Rich Context has followed a familiar progression, echoing how the history of IT and data analytics practices matured over decades -- albeit at a much faster pace.
That progression indicates likely directions for how AI applications will come into use for Rich Context.
Initial steps for Rich Context allowed researchers to analyze and report about sensistive data, while maintaining security and privacy compliance.
That's roughly analogous to data analytics during the heyday of _enterprise data warehouses_ and _business intelligence_ during the 1990s.
Subsequent work improved online workflows for data stewards, adding reports about usage along with some metadata derived as "exhaust" from logs.
That's roughly analogous to "data driven" organizations that emerged during the late 2000s after initial adoption of _data science_ practices.
Next steps, such as the Rich Context Competition, began to use _machine learning models_ to extract metadata that was embedded in unstructured data (i.e., research publication) to augment research efforts.
That's roughly analogous to the trends of machine learning adoption in industry during the mid 2010s.
In the immediate future, Rich Context applications begin to leverage  inference based on _knowledge graph_ representations about researchers, datasets, publications, data stewards, and so on.
Contemporary work in _deep learning_ promises AI-based applications that can leverage embeddings in the graph, to give social science researchers better recommendations for their work.
While that depends on historical patterns, current research on _reinforcement learning_ to explore/exploit the structure of graphs can move beyond history and patterns, effectively considering "what if" scenarios that suggest unexplored research opportunities.
That echoes the contemporary AI landscape, leading into the 2020s.

## Summary

Rich Context recognizes that social science research depends on _linked data_ usage of micro data and its metadata.
Effective management of that metadata is based on a graph that exists outside the context of component point solutions and specific workflows.
While there is substantial use of linked data for ecommerce platforms and research in life sciences, social science research presents nuances and new challenges that haven’t been addressed previously.

The Rich Context portions of the ADRF framework interconnect workflows that facilitate research – as explicit feedback loops in the graph – along with means to extract metadata from published research – as implicit feedback loops in the graph.
That process creates a kind of virtuous cycle for metadata, making use of AI applications to augment social science research, with continual improvement of the entities and relations represented within the graph.

A prerequisite was to create a corpus of research publications, used for training data during the Rich Context Competition, which demonstrated how to extract metadata from research publications.

The next step will be a formal implementation of the knowledge graph, based primarily on extensions of open standards and use of open source software.
That graph is represented as an extension of a DCAT-compliant data catalog. It will eventually incorporate the new Rich Context features going into Project Jupyter.
Immediate goals are to augment search and discovery in social science research, plus additional use cases that help improve the knowledge graph and augment research through the ADRF framework.

In the longer term, the process introduces human-in-the-loop AI into data curation, ultimately to reward researchers and data stewards whose work contributes additional information into the system.
With this latter step, in the broader sense Rich Context helps establish a community focused on contributing code plus knowledge into the research process.
