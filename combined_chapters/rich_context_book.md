# Chapter 1 - Introduction

Rich Context Introductory Chapter

Ian Mulvany, Paco Nathan, Sophie Rand, Julia Lane

Introduction
============

Science is at a crossroads. The enormous growth of access to data
coupled with rapid technological progress, has created opportunities to
conduct empirical research at a scale that would have been almost
unimaginable a generation or two ago. Researchers can now rapidly
acquire and develop massive, rich datasets; routinely fit complex
statistical models; and conduct their science in increasingly
fine-grained ways. Yet there is no automated way to search for and
discover what datasets are used in empirical research, leading to
fundamental irreproducibility of empirical science and threatening its
legitimacy and utility(*1*, *2*). There is an enormous interest to
change the current manual and ad-hoc system, and incentives are
increasingly aligned: while only a fraction of datasets are identified
in scientific research, those publications that do cite data are cited
up to 25% more than those that do not(*3*).

Vannevar Bush foreshadowed the issue more than 60 years ago:

> "There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased
> evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization
> extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions
> of thousands of other workers---conclusions which he cannot find time
> to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. ... Mendel's concept
> of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because
> his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and
> extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being
> repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in
> the mass of the inconsequential"(*11*).

We can do better -- and we now have the opportunity to do so.

The core problem that needs to be addressed is automating the search for
and discovery of datasets used in empirical data -- building an
Amazon.com for data. The vast majority of scientific data and outputs
cannot be easily discovered by other researchers even when nominally
deposited in the public domain. Faced with a never-ending stream of new
findings and datasets generated using different code and analytical
techniques, researchers cannot readily determine who has worked in an
area before, what methods were used, what was produced, and where those
products can be found. Resolving such uncertainties consumes an enormous
amount of time and energy for many social scientists. A new generation
of automated search tools could help researchers discover how data are
being used, in what research fields, with what methods, with what code
and with what findings ---often by passively capitalizing on the
accumulated labor of one's extended research community. And automation
can be used to reward researchers who validate the results and
contribute additional information about use, fields, methods, code, and
findings.(*8*)

New advances in technology---and particularly, in automation---can now
change the way in which social science, and hence other sciences, is
done. The place to start is with the social sciences. The great
challenges of our time are human in nature - terrorism, climate change,
the use of natural resources, and the nature of work - and require
robust science to understand the sources and consequences. The lack of
reproducibility and replicability evident in many fields(*1*, *4*--*7*)
is even more acute in the study of human behavior both because of the
difficulty of sharing confidential data and because of the lack of
scientific infrastructure. Social scientists have eagerly adopted new
technologies in virtually every area of social science research---from
literature searches to data storage to statistical analysis to
dissemination of results(*8*). And, in the United States, the recent
passage of the Foundations of Evidence-based Policymaking Act(*9*, *10*)
and the focus on a Federal Data Strategy, mean that there is an
important use case for showcasing the value of new approaches.

The knowing how it has been produced and used before: the required
elements what do the data ***measure***, what ***research*** has been
done by what ***researchers,*** with what ***code***, and with what
***results***. Acquiring that knowledge has historically been manual and
inadequate. The challenge is particularly acute in the case of
confidential data on human subjects, since it is impossible to provide
fully open access to the source files.

How this book came to be
========================

This book was born out of a need to solve a very concrete problem. In
2016, the US Congress passed the Commission on Evidence-based
Policymaking Act to make a set of recommendations on how to better use
data for decision-making. The US Census Bureau was charged with
supporting the deliberations of the Commission and asked our team at New
York University to build a secure access facility in which data from
multiple agencies could be securely hosted.

After we built the facility, and had dozens of users, we realized that
putting data in one place, while necessary, was not sufficient for good
analytical work to be done. Every user who accessed the data wanted to
know what other work had been done with the data, with what assumptions
and what results. We were able to provide them with some information,
but essentially the information was drawn from our own research
experience and was certainly not representative of the entire field. The
obvious solution was to see if computer scientists had the technological
tools available to automate the discovery of research datasets and the
associated research methods and fields in research publications. Our
computer science colleagues assured us that, while the technology
existed in principle, no single team was known for having developed a
solution.

We decided to see what we could to advance the field, and approached
Schmidt Sciences, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Overdeck Family
Foundation for support. As part of that support, we ran the competition
with the results described in this book. We challenged participants to
combine machine learning and natural language processing methods to
identify the datasets used in a corpus of social science publications
and infer both the scientific methods and fields used in the analysis
and the research fields.

The core of the book describes both how the competition was set up, as
well as the results achieved by different competing teams. However, as
is always the case with exciting research agendas, the competition
helped us identify five major scientific challenges that need to be
addressed: (i) document corpus development, (ii) ontology development
for dataset entity classification, (iii) natural language processing and
machine learning models for dataset entity extraction, (iv) graph models
for improving search and discovery, and (v) the use of the results to
engage the community to both validate the model results, retrain the
model and to contribute code and knowledge. So the other chapters in the
book provide an overview of what could be done with more resources and
talent devoted to this interesting question. The next section provides a
more detailed overview of the contribution of each chapter.

Book overview
=============

Section 1 provides an overview of the motivation and approach. Section 2
describes new approaches to develop corpora and ontologies. Section 3
describes the competition results in terms of model development. Section
4 provides a forward looking agenda.

Section 1: Motivation and approach

In Chapter 2, " Where's Waldo: Conceptual issues when characterizing
data in empirical research," researchers from the Research Data and
Service Center at the Deutsche Bundesbank show us why better metadata
for social science data enables discovery of datasets and research, in
ways that surpass what traditional metadata from data producers can
support. They present a new modus operandi in the service delivery model
of research data facilities, based on the premise that datasets have a
measurable value that can be deduced from the relationships between
datasets and publications, and the people who author, do research on,
and consume them - that is, Rich Context around datasets.

They argue that a major advantage of rich context is that it closes the
loop on metadata is closed: a loop initiated by the metadata from the
data producer side, is closed by metadata from the data usage side. The
authors elucidate why such rich data from the *usage* perspective is
needed to deliver codified knowledge to the research community to guide
literature review and new research; without understanding the linkage
between datasets and outcomes, we are disabled in shaping new, impactful
research.  

The authors identify two primary reasons for this need: first, that
metadata on the datasets from the data users perspective helps the data
creator to improve upon the quality of the data itself, improving
dataset owners' service delivery (e.g. bundesbank as a service provider,
the service being data provision, consulting on dataset usage, creation
of new data products, etc); and second, that metadata on the usage of
datasets in publications helps us measure impact of datasets in their
ability to drive policy-making. With this closed loop, the scope of
researchers' discovery is broadened to include not only literature and
datasets, but the interplay between those two - that is, how datasets
have been used by whom and how.   The authors discuss a tangible outcome
of measuring dataset value - a dataset recommendation system, enabling
expedient sharing of available datasets through the research community.

Chapter 3 outlines the operational approach that was taken to develop
the [Rich Context
Competition](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition).
The goal of the competition, the results of which are described in
Section 2, was to implement AI to automatically extract metadata from
research - identifying datasets in publications, authors and experts,
and methodologies used. As such, the competition was designed to engage
practitioners in AI and NLP to develop models based on a corpus
developed at the Interuniversity Consortium of Political and Social
Research. The competition attracted 20 teams from around the world and
resulted in four finalists presenting their results at NYU on February
15, 2019 (see the [agenda and video
here](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition/workshopagenda)).

The results of the competition provided metadata to describe links among
datasets used in social science research. In other words, the outcome of
the competition generated the basis for a moderately-sized knowledge
graph. the [winning
team](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/an-interview-with-the-allen-institute-for-artificial-intelligence)
in the Rich Context Competition was from [Allen
AI](https://allenai.org/) which is a leader in the field of using
embedded models for natural language. Typical open source frameworks
which are popular for deep learning research include
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (from Facebook) and the more recent
[Ray](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributed_training.html)
(from UC Berkeley RISElab).

Section 2:
===========

A major challenge is developing a training corpus that sufficiently
represents the population of all documents, and tagging the datasets in
the corpus. It is essential to do this well if high quality models are
to be developed. There is a literature outlining the issues with
developing a \"gold standard corpus\" (GSC) of language around data
being mentioned and used in analysis in academic publications, since
creating one is time-consuming and expensive (*12*) In Chapter 4
"Standardized Metadata, Full Text and Training/Evaluation for Extraction
Models", Sebastian tk and Alex Wade describe the need for, and
strategies for collecting, large sets of annotated full-text sources for
use as training data for supervised learning models developed in the
Rich Context Competition. Dataset Extraction, the NLP task at the core
of the Rich Context Competition, relies on a high-quality set of full
text sources with metadata annotations. Developing such a corpus must be
done strategically, as full-text articles and their metadata are
organized inconsistently across their sources. The corpora gathered for
use as training data for the Competition required ad-hoc manual labor to
compile. Here, authors describe the legal, technological and human
considerations in creating a corpus. They dictate the scale of full-text
data needed, and the impact that an interdisciplinary (e.g spanning
multiple domains) corpus has on that scale. They suggest development of
a corpus with open-access text resources, use of human-annotators for
labeling of full-text, and attention to the mix of domains that may be
in a corpus when developing models. 

There is a separate challenge of developing a common understanding of
what a dataset is. Developing standard ontologies is a fundamental
scientific problem, and one that is often in the domain of libraries and
information scientists. Although some measure of linguistic ambiguity is
likely to be unavoidable in the social sciences given the complex
subject matter, even modest ontologies that minimally control the
vocabulary researchers use would have important benefits. In Chapter 5,
"Metadata for Administrative and Social Science Data", Robert B. Allen
describes a framework for the application of metadata to datasets,
details existing metadata schema, and gives an overview of the
technology, infrastructure and human elements that need to be considered
when designing a rich metadata schema for describing social science
data. 

Allen describes three types of metadata - structural, administrative and
descriptive; and emphasizes the growth needed in descriptive metadata,
which are characterized by semantic descriptions. Allen describes
existing metadata schemas which accommodate domain-specific metadata
schema, like the W3C DCAT, and the unique semantic challenges faced by
social science as opposed to natural sciences - in particular that
concepts - e.g. "family", "crime" -  are less well-defined, and
definitions change across sub-domains. He considers data repositories
and describes the essential role of metadata in making such repositories
searchable and therefore useful. He touches on several prominent data
repositories in the social and natural sciences and describes their
methods of gathering metadata and how the metadata supports services
offered, like search, computing environments, preservation of data for
archives, and logging of the history of a dataset and its provenance.
Allen describes other challengings in creating and maintaining metadata,
prompted by things like changes in technology that yield data streams,
and changes in metadata standards. He discusses some of the technology
underlying data repositories; in particular data cubes for data storage
that facilitate data exploration and retrieval; containerization and
cloud computing enabling sharing and reproducibility; and collection
management systems which can provide metrics on usage, like number of
downloads, maintenance of datasets, etc. 

Section 3:
===========

Chapter 6, by the Allen AI team, describes their overarching approach.
The team used a named entity recognition model to predict dataset
mentions. For each mention, they generated a list of candidate datasets
from the knowledge base. They also developed a rule based extraction
system which searches for dataset mentions seen in the training set,
adding the corresponding dataset IDs in the training set annotations as
candidates. They then use a binary classiﬁer to

predict which of these candidates is a correct dataset extraction. While
this approach was eventually the winning approach given the design of
the corpus and the scoring mechanism, it suffers from being too fragile
for general application, since it is necessarily corpus dependent. That
team did not devote substantial time to identifying fields and methods.

Chapter 7, by the KAIST team, describes a very different approach. They
generated their own questions about dataset names and use a machine
learning technique to train the model for solving question answering
task. In other words, questions suitable for finding dataset names such
as "What is the dataset used in this paper?," are generated and the
question answering model is trained to find the answers to those
questions from the papers. Furthermore, the resulting answers from the
model are filtered by types of each word. For example, if an answer
contains words with organization or agency types, then this answer is
likely to include the actual dataset names. They also were quite
innovative with identifying research fields, by using Wikipedia as the
source, and methods by using machine learning techiques

Chapter 8, by the GESIS team, also used a Named Entity Recognition
procedure. However, their design was module-based approach and they
developed tools that can be used separately but also as parts of a data
processing pipeline. For identifying research methods and fields, they
exploited the Social Science Open Access Repository maintained at GESIS
-- Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. They also used the ACL
Anthology Reference Corpus which is a corpus of scholarly publications
about computational linguistics

Chapter 9, by the DICE team at Paderborn University, also used a Named
Entity Recognition approach. They trained an Entity Extraction model
based on Conditional Random Fields and combined it with the results from
a Simple Dataset Mention Search to detect datasets in an article. For
the identification of Fields and Methods, they essentially used search
string to find embedded words

Chapter 10, by Singapore Management University, was an incomplete
submission, with a very interesting approach. They used dataset
detection followed by implicit entity linking approach to tackle dataset
extraction task. They adopt weakly supervised classification for
research methods and fields identification tasks utilizing SAGE
Knowledge as an external source and as a proxy for weak labels.

Section 4: Looking forward
==========================

In Chapter 11, researchers from Digital Science describe the role user
engagement plays in creating rich context around datasets, which are
take on properties of 'first class research objects' (like journal
articles) in that they are published as distinct research outputs in
their own right.  Authors lay out a set of challenges in the sharing of
datasets and dissemination of dataset metadata, and articulate goals in
creating infrastructure to answer these challenges. 

As technology has yielded ever larger streams of datasets available for
social science research, two critical, interrelated elements of
infrastructure have not kept apace: information infrastructure, and
cultural infrastructure.  Information infrastructure refers to content
of interest to the rich context competition models - journal articles,
datasets, and their metadata (including details on the data stewards,
usage of the datasets in research, and code used to prepare and analyze
datasets). Cultural infrastructure refers to the incentives and value
propositions in place to encourage individual data stewards, data users
and experts to share datasets and contribute metadata on datasets.
Cultural infrastructure around datasets do not fit into the existent
culture of research publications. 

In venturing to build out information infrastructure around datasets, we
must consider how concepts like versioning, reproducibility, and peer
review carry over to datasets. Further, how do metadata carry over, when
there is so much variability in what we mean when we say dataset?
Incentives around data sharing, dataset curation, and metadata
contribution are even slimmer than in publishing, where there exists a
culture of "publish or perish." This question must be resolved if we
wish to enrich the context around datasets to make them more efficiently
consumable. 

The future agenda is described in the concluding chapter by Paco Nathan
and Ian Mulvany

The first step is to create a corpus of research publications to be used
for training data during the Rich Context Competition.

The next step will be a formal implementation of the knowledge graph,
based primarily on extensions of open standards and use of open source
software. That graph is represented as an extension of a DCAT-compliant
data catalog. Immediate goals are to augment search and discovery in
social science research, plus additional use cases that help improve the
knowledge graph and augment research.

In the longer term, the process introduces human-in-the-loop AI into
data curation, ultimately to reward researchers and data stewards whose
work contributes additional information into the system. With this
latter step, in the broader sense Rich Context helps establish a
community focused on contributing code plus knowledge into the research
process

General competition information

The competition had two phases. In the first phase, participants were
provided with labeled data, consisting of a corpus of 2,500 publications
matched to the datasets cited within them. Participants could use this
data to train and tune their algorithms. In the second phase, they were
provided with a large corpus of unlabeled documents and asked to
identify the datasets used in the documents in a test corpus, as well as
the associated methods and research fields. The participants were scored
on the accuracy of their techniques, the quality of their documentation
and code, and the efficiency of the algorithm -- and also on their
ability to find methods and research fields in the associated passage
retrieval.

## Abstract

Empirical economic and social science research uses microdata for analyses to connect theory to socie-tal problems. We present conceptual lessons learned from a machine learning competition held to au-tomate the discovery of datasets, research methods and fields in these research publications. Obtained information from the competition can be used to inform the debate about added value of the used (micro) data. Being able to measure societal benefits of data access is important to put funding decisions on an objective basis, since much research data is generated by publically funded researchers or available from official institutions. The obtained information from the competition can also be used to build a user-centric dataset recommendation system. Both of these outcomes will elevate the current knowledge generating process of empirical research.

## Introduction

Policy makers increasingly recognize that informed decision-making requires data on the characteristics of units of a population, such as individuals, households, or establishments (i.e. microdata). Only microdata can uncover interdependencies between entities and document disparate global develop-ments. Making microdata available for independent research is subject to legal requirements that are designed to prevent the disclosure of information concerning an individual person or business entity. At Deutsche Bundesbank, the Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) is tasked with making microdata available for independent research while simultaneously ensuring statistical confidentiality.

To strengthen effective quantitative research through optimal microdata usage, the RDSC has engaged in a series of projects that are targeted at enhancing user experience. One specific project currently pur-sued by the RDSC is the development of a microdata recommendation system, which is based on how microdata is being used in empirical research. Describing microdata from the usage in publications dis-tinguished this approach from traditional metadata for researchers, which is largely based on how data is produced.

Empirical research papers are an obvious source of information on dataset usage. A useful microdata recommendation system needs to rely on a corpus of dataset usage, as large as possible. Hand-curating such a sufficiently large corpus is prohibitively labor-intensive and error-prone. Thus, the competition with results described in this book to automate the discovery of datasets, associated research methods and fields in social science research publications lays the groundwork for any future implantation of such a recommendation system.

In this chapter, we present lessons learned from the competition described in this book. We do this from a background of all authors in social science. Readers interested in the more technical aspects of the competition may find Chapters 6 to 11 helpful, where participating teams explain their approaches in more detail. Furthermore, while our lessons learned revolve around datasets, fields, and mentions, Chapter 5 discusses the operational approach as well as lessons learned for designing such a competition. Finally, Chapter 13 presents in more detail a potential framework for implemeting a microdata recommendation system.

Extracting dataset citations from publications is a fairly difficult task because of the variety of dataset ci-tation formats and the absence of training data. Besides empirical research support, the gained infor-mation is the basis to provide value for policy purposes in the G20 context. For example, by providing researchers with information about the use and availability of microdata previously not being available in a systematic way, the results of the competition described in this book and the ensuing microdata recommendation system are a step towards reducing data gaps that have been diagnosed in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

On a broader level, the outcome of the competition contributes to the ongoing digitalization efforts of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Extracting relevant information from research papers as an unstructured data source broadens the value of unstructured, underexplored, data. Thus, the results of the competition presents a well-defined use-case to turn tacit knowledge into codified knowledge by converting text into relatively well-structured information. As a concrete first institutional implementation of competition results, microdata-based research will be supported by turning unstructured information into a useful source of reference for researchers.

## Insights from a research data centre perspective

### Background on research data centres

Reseach data centres (RDC) present an established operational approach to facilitate access to confidential microdata for statistical purposes. This approach is based on the theoretical framework of the "Five Safes" which was initially developed by Felix Ritchie at the UK Office of National Statistics in 2003. [^footnote1]  The first dimension refers to safe projects. This dimension mainly refers to the whether the intended use of the data conforms with the use specified in legislations or regulations. For example, a legislation may specifically allow users to use the data only for independent scientific research.

Safe people, the second dimension of the Five Saves framework, requires data users to be able to use the data in an appropriate way. A certain amount of technical skill or a minimum educational levels may be required to access the data. In contrast, safe data refers to the potential to de-identifying individuals or entities in the data. Safe settings relate to the practical controls on how the data is accessed. Different channels may exist which in turn may depend on the de-identifcation risk. In practice, the lower the de-identifcation risk the more restrictive the setting will be. Lastly, safe output refers to the risk of de-identifcation in publications from confidential microdata.

[^footnote1]: See Desai et al. (2016) for a detailed description of the Five Safes framework.

In response to the increased internal and external demand for microdata and the data confidentiality re-quirements, in 2013 the Bundesbank set up the Integrated Microdata - based Information and Analysis System (IMIDIAS) and established the Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) (for a detailed moti-vation, refer to Kalckreuth, 2014 and Bender and Staab, 2015). At the RDSC of the Bundesbank, many of the technical and organizational measures put in place to protect confidential microdata follow the Five Safes framework.

A main principle of the RDSC is to give free access to Bundesbank micro data for independent research following the Five Safe approach. Motives for doing so are to stimulate cooperation projects between researchers inside and outside of Bundesbank, get feedback on relevant topics for Bundesbank (use published research results to increase the internal knowledge) and to strengthen evidence-based policy-making on for Bundesbank relevant topics. To fulfill these tasks, the RDSC has to ensure microdata is used effectively by providing excellent services. Implementing potential for structured feedback from researchers back to data production and new research enables an improving empirical knowledge generating process.

The data access provided by the RDSC of Bundesbank and the underlying legal requirements are described in detail by Schönberg (2018). In a nutshell, the requests of users to use microdata are first reviewed pursuant to legal requirements. After the application of a researcher is approved by the RDSC, researchers conduct their research project in a secure environment designed to ensure ongoing compliance with internal data policies and external government regulations. For most microdata this requires researchers to be physically present at the premises of the RDSC in order to analyse the data. Furthermore, only strictly anonymized research outcomes may be used outside of the secure environment.

The RDSC provides access to anonymized datasets on banks, securities, investment funds, enterprises and households, all of which can be accessed at dedicated researcher workstations or for most of the Bundesbank’s surveys – as for the Panel on Household Finances (PHF) study – the RDSC offers so called scientific use files. In addition, the RDSC provides information and advice to researchers on data selection, data content and analytical approaches. Together with the relevant statistical experts, it ensures that the microdata provided are documented in detail and archived. In doing so, the RDSC works according to globally rec-ognized standards and was accredited as a research data centre (RDC) by the German Data Forum (“Rat für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsdaten”).


### The knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC

In this section we present the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC of Bundesbank. Figure 1 depicts this knowledge generating process which can be organized along the four key dimensions (i) data services, (ii) research, (iii) publication, and (iv) (structured) user specific knowledge. For simplification, we assume, that data services effects research and that the outcome of research is a publication. From a publication the RDSC (or Bundesbank) is able to destill user specific knowledge, which can be used for better services (to the "next generation" of users). In the following we discuss these dimensions in more detail and show how leveraging on (structured) user specific knowledge (dimension iv) may elevate the knowledge generating process to a higher level.

![](./combined_images/20190614_Figure1.jpg)

Figure 1: The four dimensions of the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC

The knowledge generating process starts from data sevices which are offered by the RDSC to researchers, who are analyzing data from the RDSC. Data services comprises raw microdata and comprehensive documentation of the data both of which the RDSC compiles together with the data-producing units in Bundesbank. [^footnote2] Furthermore, the data services dimension also includes the methodological improvement of microdata through e.g. applying record linkage techniques to facilitate the creation of new datasets for research. Finally, the RDSC also offers advisory services to potential and existing microdata users on topics such as e.g. dataset selection or analytical options.

[^footnote2]: Data producers in different departments across Bundesbank compile data, e.g. microdata, indicators, or time series.

The second pillar of the knowledge generating process in the RDSC is research. Researchers conduct their research project in the RDSC's secure environment and produce research outcomes. These outcomes – after statistical disclosure control by the RDSC – sometimes take the form of publications, which present results to the interested public in a form optimized for human consumption as unstructured text. These publications contain knowledge accumulated by researchers about data usage over time (experience), e.g., knowledge about dataset particularities, which in turn could be utilized to inform the debate on how to improve data services.

Examples of user specific knowledge acquired by researchers include:
+	How data is used (e.g. additional data cleaning, variable transformation, combining datasets, using additional information)
+	What purposes data is used for (e.g. topics, methodology, research area)
+	What kinds of analyses or techniques have been tried and are used ultimately
+	What information about data is most valuable to get to the results, respectively which linkage or data enrichment renders the data most valuable.

Being able to access structured user-specific knowledge through the competition described in this book enables improving data services by making discovery of data and related projects, people, and publications at Bundesbank more comprehensive and efficient. For example, knowledge harvested from publications may be used to enhance services provided by RDSC by allowing standard datasets to be tailored to the needs of re-searchers. Similarly, data producers benefit from feedback on their data, allowing them to improve data quality.

The challenge is to establish such a feedback loop. If effective feedback is given and used, the microdata-based knowledge-generating process restarts with data services, but it is elevated to a higher level. The effect of being able to leverage on information from this feedback loop is depicted in Figure 2. Better data services in turn allow better research, because available microdata is better customized and more effectively used. Better research will be published in higher ranked journals and will generate more relevant user specific knowledge, which can be used again for better services. To sum up, establishing a knowledge generating process as we have shown will lead to improvements in the four key dimensions of this process of empirical research.

  ![](./combined_images/20190614_Figure2.jpg)

Figure 2: Elevating the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC to a higher level by enabling a feedback loop to data services.

At the moment, this feedback loop is not present in a systematic way. The aim of the competition presented in this book is to identify appropriate procedures to close the gap between publication and data services, which would enable transforming knowledge available in publications into generally re-usable knowledge to inform stakeholders (data producers, RDSC, decision makers at Bundesbank). The results of the competition will thus ultimately enable better data services which in turn will make research outcomes more efficient through the channel of a better data usage.

### Added value of structured user-specific knowledge

This section details two applications of obtaining dataset usage information from publications that would add value to the data services provided for the RDSC. First, existing applications can be optimized in a user-centric way which would lead to obtaining refined products (e.g. improved researcher recommendations and data documentation). Second, the case for societal investment in free data access can be empirically fortified. Positive externalities (i.e. research as a public good) suggests a less then societally optimal provision of research data and related services. Obtaining a dataset impact factor can then make the case for further investment in microdata provision by concretely showing a dataset’s impact.

The structured user-specific knowledge produced during the competition may be used to inform the design of a dataset proposition system for researchers. By obtaining information on dataset usage in publications, data is for the first time available to construct indices on data set joint usability (and dataset maps to visualize such indices). Such an index connects datasets through actual use by researchers that combined data sets in the past. This enables recommendations, such as, “Researchers, who used dataset A, also used dataset B”.

Going further, the usability index can be expanded into a measure, how well new datasets fit each other. Without needing joint dataset usage in past publications goodness-of-fit measures may be predicted based on dataset usage in the same field, using the same methods or by additional metadata similarity. This can be a valuable accelerator to effectively distribute new datasets in the research community. While both indices can be implemented using only information from the competition, extensions may enhance value to users which are based on other information such as current metadata.

When thinking about user recommendations, the example is set by large online platforms. These online platforms can recommend from two dimensions of information (excluding interaction for simplicity). First, data is available on a large number of observed purchases per customer, which enables statements like “since you like products A and B, you might also like C”. Second, data is present on large numbers of observed customers per product, which enables statements like “users like you also bought”.

In our setting, with the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC, we consider researchers and datasets. The universe of data users and researchers is decently large (i.e. the first dimen-sion), but per user, we only observe a limited amount of “dataset consumption” (i.e. the second dimen-sion). Hence, we have a decent chance of recommending based on other users behavior. However, we have only limited means of predicting a single users future datasets needs based on his past personal “dataset shopping” behavior.

However, we suspect a simpler underlying behavioral model of “data shopping” compared to shopping through large online platforms, because publishing with one dataset is not a casual purchase. Instead, it implies real commitment relating to being content with the purchase (less cognitive dissonance). Thus, we suspect that, compared to online platforms, less data points per person are needed, in order to make sensible recommendations. Also, in order to gain more of the rare information per user, we can fall back on dataset citations, i.e. “indirect data usage”, as outlined in Chapter 3 of the book.

A challenge in building a data-driven recommendation system is to make sure that recommended da-tasets are indeed feasible to use, i.e. constitute meaningful recommendations. Thus, besides information about datasets, additional information such as fields and methods is needed to be ingested into the system. This additional information essentially constitutes additional links between datasets that helps better align datasets. This is especially true in the finance domain where linking microdata is a common feature in empirical research.

Second, the RDSC as part of a public institution has a responsibility towards its principals, i.e. society. Granting data access free of charge for researchers should be backed by empirically measurable bene-fits of such data provision. Benefits from data usage can justify societal investment in free data access. However, measuring societal benefits through data access is not obvious at first glance. One possible starting point of approximating societal benefits of data access can be to measure the creation of knowledge [^footnote3] created by specific datasets.

[^footnote3]: In our model, we have called this knowledge user specific knowledge. Here the knowledge is in that sense specific, that it can be used to fulfil the task of Bundesbank in a better way

One can argue that added value of providing administrative microdata is the marginal benefit relative to the second-best comparable commercial database, if such a database exists. Also, one can argue that a dataset, which enables causal evidence, adds more value to societal knowledge, compared to previously available datasets, from which only correlations could be deduced if an important goal is to inform the policy debate. However, both of these methods require identifying which empirical result from a publication can be attributed to which dataset.

## Lessons learned from competition

### Related literature

Extracting dataset citations from publications is a fairly difficult task because of the variety of dataset citation formats and the absence of training data (for a recent overview of data retrieval see Koesten et al., 2019). Boland et al (2012) propose a weakly supervised approach, using a pattern induction method for the detection of study references in full texts. They use a corpus of 259 publications from the Social Science Open Access Repository (SSOAR). They use a bootstrapping approach, starting with a small corpus of manually created training instances. The resulting system InfoLink now informs SSOAR.

Boland and Mathiak (2015) describe dataset extraction as a twofold task, finding dataset citation string and following entity resolution (match the string to the correct entity/ DOI). Concerning entity resolution, they report the difficulty of broad survey dataset citations that ignore data variability (such as years, versions, questionnaire variants, etc.), motivating a dataset taxonomy. Named dataset citations are often underspecified allowing identification of the survey but not of the precise dataset (which of multiple sub-samples, aggregation levels, survey modes, etc.).

Zhang et al (2016) use a bootstrapping approach to extract dataset citations from 116 computer science journals publications. Ghavimi et al. (2016) use a similar approach for social science papers finding datasets with well-documented metadata. According to them, only 25% of all dataset citations are given in the references, highlighting the unstructured citation culture for datasets. We advance from these with an environment with less available dataset metadata and a corpus of publications from a variety of fields for our purposes. To tackle this, we continue with a larger hand-curated annotated corpus.

Metadata schemas for datasets are available, such as the DataCite metadata schema and the da|ra metadata schema, which complies with the DataCite schema (Helbig et al. 2014). They offer dataset taxonomies and standardized citation propositions, however their categories do not optimally support automatic search and extraction, if no unique dataset identification (such as a DOI) is used. [^footnote4] In the con-text of central banks that provide microdata, recent progress has been made in the context of INEXDA. A metadata standard (in line with DataCite) has been developed (Bender et al. 2018) and datasets pro-vided by the RDSC are all DOI registered.

[^footnote4]: Chapter 4 discusses in more detail how metadata may support the discovery of microdata.

Improving dataset citation is high on the scientific agenda in recent years. This notably includes promot-ing widespread usage of persistent and unique dataset identifiers. As available datasets spread across a large number of databases, identification of datasets is important for reproducibility and to credit data creation efforts to incentivize data creation and publication (Lagoze and Vilhuber 2017, McMurry et al. 2017, Mooney and Newton 2012). If unique and persistent dataset identification in publications were available, Ball and Duke (2011) raise the idea of dataset impact factors with such information.

### Dataset mentions

This section presents lessons that we learned throughout the duration of the competition described in this book. These lessons originated from our motivation presented in the previous chapter and the role that we assumed. This role was twofold. First, we contributed to the corpus of publications and metadata given to competition teams. Our contribution consisted of a corpus of tagged publications of Bundesbank working papers, some of which use microdata provided by the RDSC. Second, we contributed to both evaluation phases of the competition. [^footnote5]

[^footnote5]: See Chapter 5 for a more detailed description of the evaluation process used in the competition.

We organize this section around the three sets of information that where the main focus of the competition: datasets mentions, research fields, and (statistical) methods used. We begin by describing our a priori expectation of what a dataset is. We did not delve into definitions of a dataset but rather considered it sufficiently defined for our purposes (as empirical social scientists and for the competition).

Since our approach depends on getting to know the user-perspective, we thought it plausible to let usage in empirical papers define a dataset for the purpose of the competition. Having a background in working at a large provider of financial data, we had a vague idea that all datasets would look like those the RDSC provides access to, which consist mostly of collections of structured data in matrix or database form. These datasets typically are defined by a name and with a well-defined scope, thus allowing clear citation, usually including a unique dataset identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier, DOI).

#### Lesson #1: datasets fall into two broad categories

Since the corpus of publication used for the competition spanned different domains (like healthcare, education, and others), we quickly realized that our dataset image had an econocentric bias. In social science, we learned, datasets can be categorized into two broad categories for the purposes of extraction. First, there are named datasets, i.e. well defined, usually large-scale and publicized datasets (e.g. Compustat).

Generally, named dataset mentions are short strings in the publications, have commonly used abbrevia-tions (e.g. MMSR), and often containing institution name or name of commercial data vendor. Some-times (rarely, but increasingly) these datasets can be identified by a unique digital object identifier (DOI). These datasets are usually well-defined in scope and time, with formal documentation available. While data is usually collected with a specific purpose in mind, such datasets are be used across multiple pa-pers and research domains.

The second dataset category is what we call created datasets. By created dataset we understand da-tasets usually collected or built by authors of a publication for the purpose of analyzing one specific re-search question. Often, created data comes in the form of small-scale surveys, (structured) interviews, or randomized controlled trials, RCTs. Such data normally does not have a trademark name, but instead one or multiple paragraph descriptions in the publication. Dataset information is blended together with information on data collection and sampling methods. Data reference at its most condensed form then comes in a structure like “we interview a given number of participants in a given region suffering from a given disease and code responses in the following way”.

In contrast to named datasets, created datasets usually are not referred to by a specific string or com-monly used abbreviation. Data collection is usually paper specific, and the universe of existing datasets are not easily searchable. This makes it hard for text mining algorithms to correctly extract strings referring to dataset entities. Specific created datasets are harder to use for follow-up research, and reproducibility is given only if publishers provide data together with the paper. Therefore, the lack of unique identification and search terms renders data collection potentially redundant and dataset spread not optimal.

#### Lesson #2: Fractions of dataset category are domain specific

Throughout the competition it became clear that the fraction of named and created datasets varies across social science domains. Since different fields of social sciences rely on different identification techniques and differing potentials for conducting RCTs, the predominantly used data sources naturally vary. This has important repercussions for designing a competition, since algorithm performance and later recommendation system performance varies with the input corpus and the application field.

The number of datasets used per empirical paper (linked data) also varies across research areas. This number is also dependent on named vs. created datasets. In fields with widespread use of multiple datasets at once, the added value of recommending additional useful data might be expected to be higher than in fields that create study-specific data every time. Conversely, one could argue that the marginal utility of adding additional datasets is decreasing.

The optimal way forward is to start a data recommendation system for research field with higher expected marginal utility from additional datasets. In our view, these are research areas with widespread usage of named datasets. Named datasets are constructed without the concrete research question in mind. That is why information to answer a particular research question often has to be obtained from more than one data source and is particularly true in empirical economic and finance research.

#### Lesson #3: Unique identification of datasets remains an issue

From the distinction above, one could make the argument that named datasets are easier to identify than created datasets. However, this is not the case, because the same dataset name can refer to multiple subsamples or waves of same datasets, and it is unclear where to make distinctions between dataset entities. This makes it difficult to identify the mentions referring to the same data points. Issues are, just to name a few, different time periods or subsamples, different states of data and states of knowledge, computational data pre-processing or enrichment steps. These identification issues render the current task of entity resolution of extracted dataset mentions complicated.

Unique dataset identification carries significant repercussions for reproducibility purposes, where identi-fying the exact data used for a study is paramount. For reproducibility purposes, the current solution to this dataset identification problem is the direct data upload to the publisher together with the publication. This is neither storage-efficient for large datasets nor feasible in the case of confidential microdata. A more flexible way to solve this issue is to assign unique identifiers (DOIs) to the datasets.

With a DOI (identifying the exact time frame, sampling universe, data version, wave, aggregations, state of knowledge, etc.), datasets are identified and quantitative research using confidential microdata is re-producible. To make lives easier, DOIs also drastically facilitate the automatized extraction of well-defined datasets from publications (comparable to largely standardized citations of other publications, allowing easy retrieval of publication networks, etc.).[^footnote6]

[^footnote6]  An alternative approach to ensure identification of datasets could be providing richer, more systematic metadata for datasets. See Chapter 4 in this book for a detailed discussion of this point.

Summarizing, if we successfully identify datasets and solve the issue of entity resolution, we can link and propose created datasets and thereby enable further research with such data, which takes up a notable fraction of publications in certain fields. While this task is harder than for named datasets, the potential for improvement remains larger as of today. For created datasets, too, DOI usage would be desirable; however encouragement or enforcement to use DOIs is harder in this case, because of a larger target group – authors instead of a limited number of data stewards. Even in case of widespread DOI usage for named datasets, the competition algorithms yield valuable results through the created datasets extraction in order to allow referencing and making available datasets used in the past for further analysis.

#### Lesson #4: Datasets mentions could indicate used for analysis vs. cited

After a discussion about dataset types and usage in fields, the last lesson that we learned about datasets concerns the mention of datasets in publications. These mentions come in two types. First, datasets used for empirical analysis and second, cited datasets in the literature review or references. Dataset citations (without empirical usage) can generally occur in the literature review section, even in theoretical, methodological papers, e.g. a given paper might report summary statistics based on datasets (“Author Y uses Compustat to…”). Sometimes differences between cited and used datasets are only semantic in nature. In well-written papers, the difference is usually fairly easy to distinguish for humans, but less clear for algorithms.

A key lesson we learned, is to think ahead of time, what the informational need is for the use-case at hand, used or cited datasets. Note that in an optimal setting, if information were available on the universe of datasets used for analysis in papers and on all publication citations, dataset citations would be redundant. This comes from the fact that a dataset citation in one publication is based on a dataset used for analysis in another publication and can be linked via available literature citations.

While literature citations are mostly standardized within research domains and are relatively straightforward to extract (hence publication networks / publications maps exist), information on used datasets in papers remains incomplete (even after the competition). Because of this, for the competition, we asked for used and cited datasets. It is important to note, that extracted dataset citations are always incomplete, since some authors report aggregate statistics from a different paper, but not the data behind (“Smith et al show…”).

If well separated, through extracted dataset citations, one obtains a “dataset map”, thus the “closeness of datasets”, and network measures such as centrality distinguishing important datasets (“nodes”). Through extracted empirical dataset usage on the other hand, one obtains relevant information for our purposes, namely information relating to dataset similarity and joint usage possibilities from the user perspective. However, for our envisioned recommendation system, usage of cited data (“indirect” data usage) is a valuable feature, since it yields more limited data on dataset “purchases” of a user.

As training data for the algorithms it is important to include theoretical literature, essays, etc. in the corpus of publications. [^footnote7] Obviously, this is helpful for algorithms to correctly identify true negatives, i.e. correctly identifying theoretical papers. For this task, distinguishing between cited and used datasets becomes relevant once again, because clearly separating theoretical papers that merely cite data from empirical papers depend on such a distinction.

[^footnote7]  Chapter 12 discusses potential strategies for collecting training data in more detail.

### Fields and Methods

The competition also asked participants to extract information about research fields and methods used in the publication. We want to gather this information from the user side, because data producers and annotators do not necessarily foresee all usage potential for their data and the point of our envisioned system is to increase user value. One such idea is to construct dataset similarity indices from the usage side, information is relevant not only on existing joint usage by others (“people like you often used dataset Y, too” – hence dataset extraction), but also on new dataset or linkage potentials (“this might also interest you based on your preferences”). For this, information is necessary on the context, how datasets are used.

#### Lesson #5: Think before you act: define fields and methods

To obtain the most relevant categories of research fields, we did not provide any thesauri to the competition, on purpose. The rationale behind this was to see the unhindered creativity of teams, which available information sources they would use or not use (e.g. reference datasets, Wikipedia, archive.org, other repositories, thesauri, statistical clustering techniques, etc.). On the other hand, thesauri limit the catalogue of potentially identifiable fields and methods, thus prohibiting new methods and fields to be identified in fast-changing modern research areas. Also thesauri might disturb algorithm performance, since algorithm might be forced to categorize topics and fields to older or less exact categories than necessary.

However, using thesauri does have well-known advantages, as any librarian will confirm. These advantages include easy clustering of similar fields and methods and a manageable category set of predictions. For field predictions, we generally face a fine line between too broad predictions (safe, but unin-formative) and too narrow predictions (narrow, but potentially wrong). A potential way out is backward induction here – we can present differently aggregated predictions for fields to users and get feedback from them (let users rank usability – “Was this helpful to you?”).

Concerning our definition of methods for the purpose of the competition, two questions arise. The first is the definition of statistical methods (i.e. inclusion of sampling methods, qualitative methods, etc.). Secondly, there are multiple statistical methods in a publication (besides the main causal analysis, there can be methods reported for data preparation, sampling, baseline results, robustness checks, descriptive statistics, etc.) and issues of potential weighting of importance of these.

For useful new recommendations to be provided to researchers, we decide to include in statistical methods all methods that describe potential for a merge of datasets / joint usability, hence to include all the above listed. We consider a broad definition of methods, not only including high-level statistical methods, such as ordinary least squares, but also including the observed unit, time period or even re-gression equations. If two papers then use different datasets in the same field using the same methods, there is a relatively high likelihood that those datasets can be linked or used together to create new in-sights.

### Discussion

Several decades ago, publication citation networks were constructed and to our knowledge no such undertaking has yet been done for datasets. This comes from the fact that no curated training data corpus is readily available in decent quality. Since no such data is available, we manually annotate papers for the competition and now propose to go forward with this in a larger scale.

We would have no need for this competition in a world with universal dataset identifier usage (such as DOIs). In such a scenario, unique identification and standardized citations of datasets would be readily available. Since DOIs only now and slowly gain widespread application for datasets in social science, our task is a 1:n mapping of publications to datasets without unique identifiers. For scientific papers, many journals already provide DOIs for papers.

There are ongoing efforts by journals to have all used data published for reproducibility reasons. Incentivizing researchers to provide unique identification of datasets used in papers is a logical next step. This will ensure reproducibility for confidential microdata and facilitate our use-cases. In the meantime, we show a way forward to learn from the current state of information and analytically use presently available information.

The competition highlights that datasets can be categorized in different dimensions for the purposes of extracting dataset mentions from publications. We propose a binary distinction of datasets into named as opposed to created datasets. As named datasets, we consider formal, large datasets by commercial or official institutions, often referenced in relatively standardized forms as commonly used abbreviations. Created datasets are those created for the specific purpose of one research question in mind. They are generally described in less standardized paragraphs. Usage of named versus created datasets varies across research areas.

Also varying across research areas is the number of datasets used per empirical paper. This number al-so depends on the spread of formal, named datasets as opposed to created datasets for single studies. In fields with widespread use of multiple datasets at once (linked data), the added value of recommending additional useful data might be expected to be higher than in fields that create study-specific data every time. Conversely, one could argue that the marginal utility of adding additional datasets is decreasing. The optimal way forward is to start a data recommendation system for research field with higher expected marginal utility from additional datasets.

## Conclusions

In the competition described in this book, we asked teams to extract datasets, fields and methods from a corpus of hand-annotated research publications. The value of the extracted information lies in informing a user-centric dataset recommendation system and thereby enabling optimal and timely spread of available datasets throughout the research community. Furthermore, such information allows us to compute dataset impact factors by obtaining data-driven information on which datasets underlie high-quality research outputs. This in turn is a proxy for societal benefits of data provision by research data centres, thus motivating in-vestment in data access infrastructure.

We introduce a circular model of the knowledge generating process, which increases in levels. From data services, research is conducted, publications are published and user-specific knowledge is generated. Having such knowledge on dataset usage, data services in turn can be improved, which elevates research, publications and user specific knowledge. Thereby, the circle repeats on a higher level. The current competition works on strengthening the knowledge pillar as well as the transmission mechanisms from publications to knowledge to improved data services. [^Footnote8]

[^Footnote8]: For the future, ongoing effort is needed to support all four “corners of the circle” / “pillars of the level model”. The current competition strengthens the arrow from publication to knowledge and structures gained knowledge to improve data services. To support the data services pillar – for example -, digital RDC environments with facilitated access processes like a “data stewardship module” will in our view improve data access.

Automatic processing of generated knowledge in publications becomes increasingly available with modern text analysis tools. Extracting such information is important, because timely and optimal usage of gained results increases the speed, by which findings can be incorporated into data services and thereby next-level research is enabled in turn. To further improve automatic processing, minimum standards for dataset taxonomy are needed. Harmonized metadata schemas for data sets – like the INEXDA metadata schema for central banks and statistical offices (compliant with and building upon DataCite) – offer such an approach.

The competition showcased that information extraction of the necessary information for such systems is possible. The delivered prototype algorithms prove this claim. With the proof of concept, there is a more substantiated case for investing in a larger hand-curated training corpus of annotated research papers. On the road towards a user-centric dataset recommendation and metadata system, the competition forced us to clarify organizational needs and methodological aspects.

For the way forward, it is important to note the importance of the research area on the strategic path towards a unified user-centric microdata recommendation system. The choice of the research domain will greatly influence algorithm performance. Since human effort in creating training data is expensive, one should deliberately pick research domains to start with. This arises because text extraction algorithms (and humans) struggle with informally described created datasets. The low-hanging fruits of prototyping dataset recommendation systems, usability indices etc. are easier to implement for research areas with a largely formalized dataset citation culture (however ultimately potential for benefits may well be larger in other research areas).

3.1 Introduction
----------------

The relationship between research, researchers and data is changing.
Data has always played a critical role in scientific research, however
in recent years it has taken centre stage not only for the so-called
hard sciences, but also for the social sciences, and it has an
increasing role in the humanities (Giuliano, 2019). We assert that this
change is, at least in part, driven by two key factors: First, the
increasing volume of data that is available to researchers either, for
example, through the increasing sensitivity of instruments that aid
experimental work, or through the ubiquity of computer systems with
which we interact in our daily lives. Second, our ability to process and
analyse these data is growing quickly as computers become faster and
algorithms become more powerful. While some researchers welcome having
more data to work with, others are challenged or marginalised in this
new data-rich world (Eijnatten et al., 2013; Grusin, 2014; Leurs and
Shepherd, 2017). These effects are often compounded by the tools that
researchers must master to connect their research to data.

In the hard sciences, the CERN Open Data Portal contains 131 datasets
describing particle collisions, each of which comprise around 300Gb of
data at the time of writing (CERN, 2019). In the social sciences, the
CISER Data Archive at Cornell is home to more than 1000 different social
science data sets (CISER, 2019). These examples are individual instances
chosen at random from many that could be used to demonstrate the variety
and scale of data available for research. However, even these examples
don't begin to quantify the amount of detailed personal data available
to companies such as Facebook. Data of this latter kind has already been
used in academic studies as well as in more controversial contexts
(Jordan and Weller, 2018; Kamp et al., 2019; Stark, 2018). Clearly,
there is an increasing diversity and depth of data available for
research from both traditional and from new sources.

Many researchers now work with large volumes of data. Fortunately, many
facilitating technologies have become commoditised and are available at
a fraction of their original cost: storage is cheap and data transfer is
fast. But, Increasing the value of data to researchers is no longer
about technology, rather it is about the information and culture around
the data.

In this chapter, we take our lead from Chapter 1 in recognising not only
that science is at a crossroads but that the whole of research is
changing. We discuss two elements of infrastructure that, if enhanced,
can make data more useful and valuable to the whole research community:
information infrastructure and cultural infrastructure. The Rich Context
project supports the development of tools that enrich not only
information infrastructure around datasets, but which also enhance the
cultural infrastructure. *Information infrastructure* includes details
of the approach to data stewardship, context of usage, code applied to
the dataset in its production, as well as code applied to the data to
derive further results or translate it for practical uses. All these
factors add critical elements to the research infrastructure. *Cultural
infrastructure* includes creating the incentives, triggers and
frameworks that encourage the dataset stewards, experts and users to
contribute to these critical information elements.

3.2 Information Infrastructure
------------------------------

Information infrastructure can be defined as the collection of processes
and artefacts that are foundational to today's scholarly communications.
A simplified model of scholarly communications would have artefacts such
as journals, journal articles, article metadata and citations. In this
case, the processes would be peer review and scholarly search.

When creating one of the first scientific journals *Philosophical
Transactions* 350 years ago, the members of the Royal Society did not
have today's data-centric world in mind. While a clear line can be drawn
from the articles of that time to the articles of today, infrastructures
have grown up around research publications in the intervening years that
have moved the structures and expectations of the research article
forward. These norms are powerful and persistent through their ubiquity.
For example, in the large majority of modern research literature, we
continue expect articles to be grouped into journals and published on a
specific date, and we expect there to be a version of record that
constitutes a definitive record of a piece of research.

Data is more fluid than a standard research article: it is produced and
updated more frequently and iteratively; it needs to be shared with many
in a collaborative context; it is processed and versioned by different
colleagues. Data does not fit into the normalised research publication.
Research fields that rely on data are beginning to publish data as a
distinct output from a research article. Data is becoming a principal
research output, while the technological challenges of publishing data
are being addressed, the format and necessary fields of the metadata
that describe data, the file format in which the data resides, the
resource to annotate the data to make it useful to others, the way in
which data should be cited in a paper or by another dataset, the
description of the processing that has been applied to the data, the
details of the ethical review process behind the exercise that gathered
the data, and many other norms do not yet exist homogeneously across
subjects and geographies. There are not yet strongly established norms
that help researchers to have trust in data.

A dataset can change with time for many reasons: data may be added over
time, corrections may be issued, and so on. In these cases, it may be
appropriate to "version" the dataset (by issuing a persistent identifier
for a point-in-time snapshot for the dataset, allowing subsequent
changes to receive their own "versions"). But changes to a dataset may
have a knock-on effect on the interpretation of the data and may
fundamentally alter the research result that was originally reported.
Moreover, in many fields "Big Data" is so central that it not only puts
pressure on the community to establish an acceptable model of data
publication, but also puts significant stress on how we read, interpret,
and review research as a whole.

Many datasets are now so vast that we lack the ability as humans to
consume them in an easy way. Visualisation technologies and other tools
that allow us to interact with and sample data dynamically have received
significant attention in recent years, and have helped with the
interpretation of data in online environments. But it is simply
impossible to reduce some types of data to a single figure or printable
table, as would be the case for "traditional" journal publishing. By
attempting to do so, we miss the essence of the data and risk failing to
communicate data-driven conclusions accurately. This limitation of
current publication formats (e.g. static PDF files for articles) is an
issue that relates to the reproducibility crisis of modern research.

Peer review is another process that is not easy to apply to data as a
"first class" research object. Historically, peer reviewers have ensured
that a piece of research is well-communicated and correct in the sense
that it is reproducible. This level of peer review is difficult to apply
in the context of research data. If data is being published as a primary
output, then it may be possible to perform a kind of peer review by
applying some statistical tests to a sample of the data, or by using
some other appropriate technique. However, it is no longer practical in
most cases to set up a parallel experiment to reproduce data, as had
been the case in years past. Across all contexts there are good reasons
for these challenges: the experiment may be too costly to repeat, or the
conditions of the original data collection may not be replicable (for
example, surveying stress levels of the populace during a specific
political event). In addition, ethical considerations such as the
anonymity of those being surveyed may make certain types of data
difficult to review. Thus, we need to develop robust and accepted
approaches to peer review, not only for data itself but also for those
publications that are heavily based on data. Without peer review or some
suitable proxy for peer review that makes sense for data, it is
difficult to know whether a dataset can be trusted. Without trust, a
dataset has no value to a researcher who seeks to build upon it.

Several publishing innovations have made journal articles more
discoverable and accessible in recent years, such as preprint servers,
the widespread use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), and centralized
search engines. However, while some of these infrastructures do enhance
a researcher's ability to find research data, they do not fully
translate from the realm of journals to data. There are multiple reasons
for this lack of translation, some of the key features include: a)
weakness of a homogeneous metadata infrastructure for datasets; b)
inhomogeneity in the types of data that can be shared; c) proliferation
of different platforms to store data; d) lack of standardised
publication practices; e) lack of adoption of standards across fields.
When compared with the "shape" of an academic article for which there is
a standard structure (e.g. DOI, abstract, title, authors, keywords, etc)
specifically designed to facilitate human search, it is clear that
datasets are contextualised by an immature information infrastructure.

Datasets are more complex to classify and annotate than articles, yet
some progress is being made. The core fields required to create a valid
DataCite record are identifier, creator, title, publisher, publication
year and resource type (DataCite Metadata Working Group, 2016). All
other data fields are optional (e.g. location, funder, subject,
contributors) due to the fundamental uncertainty in what might
constitute research data in the future. This flexibility limits how data
can be discovered. It has taken some years for Web of Science, Google
and others to introduce functionality to search for datasets in their
discovery systems.

Technological infrastructure for data\--or lack thereof\--has huge
implications for the discovery, peer review, citation practices,
interpretation, and availability of data. These challenges are
interconnected with challenges we face when thinking about the cultural
infrastructure for data, as well.

3.3 Cultural Infrastructure
---------------------------

There are two main aspects to cultural infrastructure: incentives and
capability. Both aspects affect how researchers engage with research
data, and their behaviours relating to sharing it with others and making
it available to external scrutiny.

Anecdotally, academics do not typically take up research careers for
financial gain. Rather, they choose to dedicate themselves to
understanding a specific problem or field partially in the hope of
making a discovery. For most researchers, success is not strongly
coupled to prize winning, but rather by winning the freedom to determine
their own research agenda. Researchers in many fields are promoted by
publishing in specific high-impact journals, leading to funding success,
which in turn usually leads to greater control of your research.

Sharing data is often not well-aligned with the current model of
incentives. Parting with the data that underpins your research gives
rise to two concerns. Firstly, that someone may find an error in your
work and discredit what you have done. Secondly, that someone else may
not share their own data but will gladly reuse yours if you make it
available. This is especially the case in fields where success is based
on having more data to analyse.

A further level of inequity exists in which data-related jobs are valued
by the Academy. If a researcher happens to be particularly talented in
working with data curation, data analysis or data processing, there is
no track for recognising these talents. They are unlikely to be a first
author on a publication in a major journal due to their data wrangling
talents, and hence they have less of a chance of career progression than
researchers who take a more traditional "publish or perish" path with
their work as described above.

This set of perverse incentives means that people with the capability to
handle data are often incentivised to leave research. Hence, not only do
we have a problem of incentives in sharing and communicating data, but
we also have a problem in retaining people who have the capability that
we need to structure data so that it can be shared and built upon.

Capability for sharing data is the second aspect of the cultural
challenge that academia continues to wrestle with. Making data available
to others is generally accepted as a key part of the research
communication process. However, there are certain established norms
around when the data should be shared, and to what depth it is shared
(Linek et al., 2017); for example, in fields where human subjects
research is prevalent, there is a much more conservative attitude
towards open data than in fields like astronomy where data sharing is
widely practiced, given that data can be collected by only a handful of
observatories and telescopes worldwide.

In fields that are more applied, ensuring that data generated as a
result of a commercial relationship is protected is crucial. In such
fields, academics often have a better understanding of copyright,
intellectual property rights and licences (Treadway et al., 2016). But
outside of this context, there is a general lack of understanding of
these issues and hence data are often not shared over concerns for a
perceived legal barrier.

Other concerns are ethical---for example, should these data be shared if
it might infringe the rights of the subjects of the research?
Researchers are beginning to become aware that, through the use of
algorithms, some data is not as well anonymised as it may first appear
(Siddle, 2014). Anonymisation of data is a research field in and of
itself (Li et al., 2007).

The degree and nature of ethical issues and industry-proximity vary
greatly between different research fields and give rise to different
cultures of data usage and re-usage across fields and even within
fields. Some researchers are motivated to engage with the open access
community and hence choose approaches to sharing data that include
granting permissive licences, association of unique identifiers with
data, adherence to data standards and training students to adhere to
similar approaches. Other researchers are motivated to ensure that data
are not shared due to the information that can be inferred by processing
the data.

The power of the newest algorithms, or of algorithms yet to come, mixed
with constantly developing ethical nuance means that it is difficult to
pre-empt what may or may not be acceptable to share in the future.
Hence, some may feel that it is simply better not to share, especially
in the social sciences, where many of these issues are more prone.

Other concerns are simply practical---how does one make data available
in a way that is meaningful to others? The work associated with making a
dataset generically machine-readable is challenging for many
researchers, who are not to be experts in data handling. The work
associated with making a dataset human-understandable, reproducible and
fully contextualised is often significant. Funding constraints may make
it impractical to share data or to add useful, valuable or even critical
annotations to a dataset. However, funders are beginning to prioritise
these activities in their grant programs (Jisc, 2019; NNLM, 2019). All
these factors lead to uncertainty exacerbated by different levels of
confidence and understanding and consequently an uneven landscape in
what is shared, how it is shared and where it is shared.

 3.4 Enriching context
---------------------

The points discussed above offer some indication of what would be needed
to improve the value of research data. Firstly, to address issues of
cultural infrastructure, we need to adopt an expanded version CredIT
(Allen et al., 2014) that focuses on datasets. This expansion would
ensure that all contributors to a dataset's creation, development and
maintenance over time are stored in a machine-readable format. Such a
record is central to the facilitation of culture change across research.
Only with this structure in place can the activities around datasets be
readily recognised and incentives created that would support data
sharing. Secondly, to address the deficits in information
infrastructure, a set of tools that allow research data to be discovered
and contextualised needs to be introduced. In this section, we focus on
this second challenge.

The ability to add context any piece of research was a strong driver for
the creation of Dimensions (Hook et al., 2018). The idea that all
research happens in a particular place, at a particular time, carried
out by a set of people, some of whom may be affiliated with a research
institution, gives a set of metadata that allows us the "weak context"
of a piece of research. By "weak context" we mean that the context being
provided gives no deep understanding of the context of an article to a
non-expert and is essentially indistinguishable from standard metadata.
But with modern data mining approaches, it is possible to add a "strong
context".

Strong contextualisation of research should provide a user with rich
information about the research including funding, other research
produced as part of the larger project (e.g. related publications,
clinical trials, etc), and details of the research that was built on top
of it. This information should also fit into, trends and graphical
representations that offer a more complete, more rapid understanding of
how research fits into the larger field, related fields, or the context
of the publishing journal or supporting institution. For example, for a
research article, we should be able to quickly understand how many
researchers are in a related field, whether the field is growing, how
old the field is, how much funding has been deployed in the field, which
countries have provided that funding, whether the field has begun the
translation to application through patents or clinical trials, or
whether it has been used as a basis for the formulation of policy.

Context can also be offered in the data that we provide to understand
the reach and influence of research.

Alternative metrics ("altmetrics") are data from the social web that run
orthogonal to classic citation measures, which can be seen to add
significant context to an article -- extending our understanding of how
different cohorts of potential users of the research are engaging with
it. For example, altmetrics can be used to understand if an article is
being mentioned in the news, in which geographical regions it is being
noticed, whether it is being used as part of a teaching syllabus, and
many other kinds of public and non-traditional scholarly engagement.
These data can then be visualized in creative ways to add instant
additional context to engagement with a research article (see Fig. 3.1).

height="2.5277777777777777in"}

research output.

How datasets are used in research more broadly is another important
piece of context that data search engines lack that would significantly
enhance discoverability of a dataset and that would consequently
increase the value of the data. This is where the Rich Context project
can add significant value to a broad research community.

Enhanced context for research data and its impacts could be offered to
users in the form of in-app badges and other "signposts" that connect
data with its larger context. Such a contextualizing badge could bring
together existing data, including not only the number of citations that
the dataset has received, but also whether the data has been versioned
(through Figshare's repository metadata), discussed online (through
Altmetric data), and what kind of tools and insights have been built on
top of the data (through rich mining of full-text and citation data
available in the ReadCube reference management corpus and in
Dimensions).

Correctly developed and accepted by the community, this type of
information can make a contribution to solving many of the problems
highlighted in this article. If the correct contextual facets can be
developed, then recognition would be easier to assign to those who have
contributed to the process of creating and maintaining datasets. With
greater context around them, datasets become easier to locate,
understand and value. This in turn could lead to a broader evaluative
environment and more engagement from academics.

Engagement across academia, however, is not uniform. Mechanisms need to
be provided to engage data science-focused researchers from whom more
details of their tools, scripts and codebooks could be drawn, adding
further value to research data. At the same time, engagement tools need
to allow data scientists to leverage this information so that it is
valuable to them when they are the consumers of search results. These
are subtly different use cases from those of standard researchers. By
mining ever more open research systems wherein data is being analyzed
(e.g. Gigantum, Github, etc), we can start to integrate these other
crucial engagement contexts as well.

*Figure 3.3: Mock-up of a research data badge helping to contextualise a
specific dataset.*

In Figures 3.2 and 3.3, we have visualised some early concepts for how a
contextualized research data badge could look. This visualisation is
based on insights from the Rich Context project and uses data that could
be mined from articles that use a specific dataset. In particular, we
suggest four facets of context that both data science-focused
researchers and others could find helpful when viewing a dataset:

-   **Experts** **who have made use of the data**, sourced from
    references made to the dataset in a professional context such as an
    industry whitepaper or policy document

-   **Academics** that **cite the data**, mined from citation of the
    dataset or ancillary data in the peer reviewed literature

-   **End users of the data**, sourced from code book references
    included in public code repositories

-   **Enhancements of the data**, vis-à-vis annotations and comments
    made on the data in public forums.

In summary, we believe that, if deployed across the many environments in
which researchers discover data, the thinking behind the Rich Context
project can overcome both the cultural and information-based
infrastructure challenges that we highlighted. If these challenges can
be overcome by the methods developed, for example in Chapter 13 of this
volume, then this will significantly extend the use and discoverability
of datasets. The number and variety of datasets in use in academia will
certainly expand in the future, and we can only see data becoming even
more central to contemporary research efforts. As such, it is critical
to invest in robust infrastructures, not only to support the production
and sharing of these data, but also to change the culture and evaluative
environment around research data. It is only through initiatives such as
these that we will be able to solve the vast and complex sociotechnical
challenges that face academia today.

# Chapter 4 - Metadata for Social Science Datasets

> Metadata for Administrative and Social Science Data

Robert B Allen

\[0000-0002-4059-2587\]

rba\@boballen.info

Data are valuable but finding the right data is often difficult. This
chapter reviews current approaches to metadata about numeric data and
considers approaches that may facilitate the identification of relevant
data. In addition, the chapter reviews how metadata support
repositories, portals, and services. There are many emerging metadata
standards, but they are applied unevenly so that there is no
comprehensive approach. There has been greater emphasis on structural
issues than on semantic descriptions.

INTRODUCTION
============

Evidence-based policy needs relevant data (Commission on Evidence-Based
Policy, 2018; Lane, 2016). Such data is often difficult to find and use.
The FAIR Open Access guidelines suggest that, ideally, data should be
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).[^1] Broad and
consistent metadata can support these needs. Metadata and other
knowledge structures could also supplement and ultimately even replace
text.

This chapter surveys the state of the art of metadata for numeric
datasets, focusing on metadata for administrative and social science
records. Administrative records describe details about the state of the
world as collected by organizations or agencies. They include
governmental, hospital, educational, and business records. By
comparison, social science data generally is collected for the purpose
of developing or applying theory.

We start by considering data and datasets (Section 2) and basic
principles of metadata and their application to datasets (Section 3).
Modern metadata is often implemented with Resource Description Framework
(RDF) linked data (Section 4). Section 5 introduces ontologies and other
semantic approaches. We then move to applications which use metadata.
Section 6 examines repositories that hold and distribute collections of
datasets. Section 7 describes services and techniques associated with
repositories and Section 8 briefly describes the computing
infrastructure for repositories.

DATA ELEMENTS AND DATASETS
==========================

While data may be incorporated in text, image, or video, here we focus
on numeric observations recorded and maintained in machine-readable
form. Individual observations are rarely used in isolation. Rather, they
are typically collected into datasets.

A dataset is defined in the W3C-DCAT (W3C - Data Catalog Vocabulary)[^2]
as "a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent"[^3]
such as a statistical agency. There are many different types of
datasets; they differ in their structure, their source, and their use. A
given data element may appear in many different datasets and may be
numerically combined with other data to form derived data elements which
then appear in still other datasets. In some cases, they are single
vectors of data; in other cases, they comprise all the data associated
with one study or across a group of related datasets. Reference datasets
are generally collected and archived because they are of enduring value
and can be used for answering many different types of questions. Other
datasets, such as an individual's medical records, are associated with a
relatively narrow set of applications.

There is wide variability in the organization and contents of datasets,
as well as in the extent to which datasets are validated and curated.
Potentially with frameworks such as the SDMX (Statistical Data and
Metadata eXchange) Guidelines for the Design of Data Structure
Definitions,[^4] concise structured descriptions can be developed for
how data elements are combined to form datasets.

METADATA SCHEMAS AND CATALOGS
=============================

Many datasets are available; the DataCite repository alone contains over
five million datasets. Metadata can support users in finding datasets
and enable users to know what is in them. Metadata are short descriptors
which refer to a digital object. However, there is tremendous
variability in the types of metadata and how they are applied. One
categorization of metadata identifies structural (or technical),
administrative, and descriptive metadata (Riley, 2017). Structural
metadata includes the organization of the files. Administrative metadata
describes the permissions, rights, preservation and usage relating to
the data.[^5] Descriptive metadata covers the contents.

A metadata element describes an attribute of a digital object. The
simplest metadata (e.g., a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or ORCiD[^6])
identifies the digital object or its creator.[^7] Metadata elements are
generally part of a schema, or frame. DCAT[^8] is a schema standard for
datasets that is used by many repositories such as data.gov. Other
structured frameworks for datasets include the DataCite[^9] metadata
schema and the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
Research Data Documentation Initiative (ICPSR DDI, see Section 6.1). ISO
19115-1:2014 establishes a schema for describing geographic information
and services. [^10]

The schema specifications provide a flexible framework. For instance,
DCAT allows the inclusion of metadata elements drawn from domain schema
and ontologies. Some of these domain schemas are widely used resources
which DCAT refers to as assets. Figure 1 shows a fragment of properties
(i.e., metadata elements) from an implementation of the Schema.org[^11]
dataset schema to describe gross domestic product.

Figure 4.1: Fragment of GDP properties described by the Schema.org
dataset schema.[^12]

Metadata terms for an application are often assembled into namespaces
from different metadata schemas. Metadata Application Profiles[^13]
provide constraints on the types of entities that can be included in the
metadata for a given application. Moreover, application profiles can be
used to validate standards. For instance, the DCAT Application Profile
for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) supports the integration of data
drawn from repositories in different jurisdictions in the EU.[^14]

A collection of dataset schema,[^15] such as all the datasets in a
repository, forms a catalog. For data streams, there needs to be
continuity but also the ability to update the records. In some cases,
there may be relatively infrequent periodic updates. These could be
given version numbers rather than an entirely new DOI.[^16] However,
collections of highly dynamic data streams present challenges; most of
the data stay the same but some of the data and/or metadata (e.g.,
number of records) change.

LINKED DATA
===========

RDF (Resource Description Framework) extends XML by requiring triples
which assert a relationship (property) between two identifiers:
"identifier -- property - identifier". RDF Schema (RDFS) extends RDF by
supporting subclass relationships. A graph is formed by linking triples.

Hierarchical classification systems are another knowledge structure with
a long history. Indeed, Schema.org is based around a hierarchical
ontology. Simple classification relationships are handled by the Simple
Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). SKOS represents the hierarchical
structure of traditional thesauri with RDFS. Collections of data
organized by SKOS are often described as "linked data".

Depending on the rigor with which they are developed, these collections
can support limited logical inference. Many administrative and
social-science-related thesauri, such as EDGAR and those of the World
Bank and the OECD, have now been implemented with SKOS. A knowledgebase
is, primarily, a SKOS graph that links real-world entities. For example,
Wikidata[^17] is an effort to develop a knowledgebase based on
structured data from Wikimedia projects, and VIVO[^18] is a knowledge
graph of scholarship.

But there are also many stand-alone classification schemes. The Extended
Knowledge Organization System (XKOS)[^19] was developed to allow
classification systems to be incorporated into a SKOS framework.

RICHER SEMANTICS
================

Ontologies provide a coherent set of relationships between entities
which cover a given domain. Well-constructed ontologies can support
logical inference. Some vocabularies such as Dublin Core, which is
implemented in RDF, are said to have an ontology, but they are limited
because relationships among the terms are not specified. FOAF (Friend of
a Friend) provides a somewhat richer ontology which includes attributes
associated with people. Still more extensive ontologies often use OWL
(Web Ontology Language) which can support stronger logical inference
than RDFS.

One way to coordinate across terms is an upper ontology. Upper
ontologies provide top-down structures for the types of entities allowed
in domain and application ontologies. One of the best-known upper
ontologies is the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) (Arp, Smith, & Spear,
2015), which is a realist, Aristotelian approach. At the top-level, BFO
distinguishes between Continuants (endurants) and Occurrents
(perdurants) and also between Universals and Particulars (instances).
Many biomedical ontologies based on BFO are collected in the Open
Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry.[^20]

There are fewer rich ontologies dealing with social science content than
for natural science. Social ontology, that is, developing rigorous
definitions for social terms, is often a challenge. It is difficult to
define precisely what is a family, a crime, or money. In most cases, an
operational or approximate definition may suffice when formal
definitions are difficult. However, those operational definitions often
do not interoperate well across studies.

DATA REPOSITORIES AND COLLECTIONS OF DATASETS
=============================================

A data repository holds datasets and related digital objects. Ideally,
it contains a stable collection selected according to a collection
policy. It is organized by metadata and knowledge structures. It
provides access to the datasets and typically supports search.

The Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICPSR[^21] is a major repository of public-use social science and
administrative datasets derived mostly from questionnaires and surveys.
We go into depth about it here because the ICPSR Data Documentation
Initiative (DDI)[^22] (e.g., Vardigan, Heus, & Thomas, 2009) is
especially well-crafted.[^23] The DDI codebook saves the exact wording
of all the questions and ICPSR provides an index of all variable names.
DDI-Lifecycle is an extension that describes the broader context in
which the survey was administered as well as the details about the
preservation of the file (see Section 7.1). **DDI uses XKOS to provide
linked data.** Figure 2 shows the ICPSR DDI metadata schema.

The ICPSR metadata elements incorporate aspects of the implementation
and design of research studies. However, many of the ICPSR metadata
elements are not independent; potentially, they could be interlinked
with terms such as organizations, locations, individuals, and research
designs from other knowledgebases. Moreover, they could be linked with
higher-level workflows and mechanisms (see Sections 7.1, 7.5).

Additional Examples of Repositories
-----------------------------------

Statistical data collection is a core function of government. Such
collections often emphasize social data such as employment, criminal
justice, and public health. They also include related indicators such as
agricultural and industrial output and housing. Most countries have
national statistical agencies such as Statistics New Zealand, and the
Korean Social Science Data Archive (KOSSDA). European datasets are
maintained in the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives
(CESSDA)[^24] and the European Social Survey.[^25] Australia has a broad
data management initiative, ANDS.[^26] Many U.S. federal governmental
datasets are collected at data.gov. In addition, there are many other
social survey repositories[^27] and many U.S. states and cities have
online statistics sites at varying levels of sophistication.

There are also many non-governmental and inter-governmental agencies
such as the OECD, the World Bank, and the United Nations that manage
datasets. Similarly, there are very large datasets from medical research
such as from clinical trials and from clinical practice including
Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

Many datasets are produced, curated, and used in the natural sciences
such as astronomy and geosciences. Some of these datasets have highly
automated data collection, elaborate archives, and established curation
methods. Many repositories contain multiple datasets for which access is
supported with portals or data cubes (see Section 7.4). For instance,
massive amounts of geophysical data and related text documents are
collected in the EarthCube[^28] portal. The science.gov portal is
established by the U.S. Office of Science Technology and Policy. NASA
supports approximately 25 different data portals. Each satellite in the
Earth Observation System (EOS) may provide hundreds of streams of
data,[^29] with much common metadata. Likewise, there are massive
genomics and proteomics datasets which are accessible via portals such
as UniProt[^30] and the Protein Data Bank[^31] along with suites of
tools for exploring them.

Repository Registries
---------------------

There are a lot of different repositories, so it is useful to have a
registry with a standard schema structure for describing them. The
Registry of Research Data Repositories[^32], which is operated by
DataCite, links to more than 2000 repositories each of which holds many
datasets. Each of those repositories is described by the re3data.org
schema (Rücknagel, Vierkant, et al., 2015).

Ecosystems of Texts and Datasets
--------------------------------

Datasets are often associated with text reports, whether they describe
the development of the datasets or their use. Ultimately, we would like
to be able to move seamlessly from datasets to texts and other related
materials. However, as demonstrated by several of the papers in this
volume, it is often difficult to extract details about datasets from
legacy publications.

Text associated with a dataset may be used to support searching for it.
Indeed, Google Dataset Search uses texts marked up with Schema.org
JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) micro-data to
generate an index.

Going forward, great value can be achieved by persuading editors and
authors to clearly cite and deposit datasets. In some cases, a separate
data editor may be appointed. The Dryad Digital Repository[^33] captures
datasets from scholarly publications. It requires the deposit of data
associated with scholarly papers accepted for publication. Such datasets
are most often used to validate the conclusions of a research
publication, but they may also be used more broadly.

Research datasets may be given DOIs[^34] and cited in much the same way
that research reports are cited. Formal citations can support tracing
the origins of data used in analyses and help to acknowledge the work of
the creators of the datasets.

Information Institutions and Organizations
------------------------------------------

The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) provides a reference model
for the management of archives (Lee, 2010). A key part of the model is
the inclusion of preservation planning and the requirement for stable
administration over time. These attributes are part of all information
institutions. Libraries, archives, and museums have formal collection
management strategies, metrics, and policies.

In addition to traditional information institutions, there are now many
other players. CrossRef[^35] and DataCite are DOI registration agencies.
CrossRef is a portal to metadata for scholarly articles, while DataCite
provides metadata for digital objects associated with research.
Schema.org's primary mission is to provide a structure that improves
indexing by search engine companies. Still other organizations such as
HL7[^36] and KEGG[^37] manage controlled vocabularies and frameworks.
These organizations are increasingly adopting best practices similar to
those of traditional information organizations.

REPOSITORY SERVICES
===================

Administrative Metadata and Related Services
--------------------------------------------

Administrative metadata is one of the three broad categories of
metadata. Administrative metadata describes the permissions, rights,
preservation, and usage of the data. While the focus of a traditional
library is to support access and the focus of an archive is to ensure
stability and quality, increasingly, digital repositories must address
both access and preservation.

**Preservation and Trusted Datasets:** Although data storage prices are
declining dramatically, the cost of maintaining a trusted repository
remains substantial and we cannot save everything. These challenges are
familiar from traditional archives; selection policies typical in
archives could help in controlling the many poorly documented datasets
in some repositories. Yet, prioritization of what to select is difficult
(Whyte & Wilson, 2010)[^38].

Lost data is often irreplaceable. Even if the data is not entirely lost,
users need confidence that the validity of stored data has not been
compromised. Indeed, some data may become the target of malicious
attacks. Trust is a result of both technology and organizational
procedures. Technology may include hash-based encoding of data.
CLOCKSS[^39] is a distributed hash system for web-based scholarly
literature. Blockchains provide hashed records of transactions and can
be applied to data records.

The OAIS framework has been incorporated into the ICPSR DDI-Lifecycle
model. The integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS)[^40] is a
policy-based archival management system[^41] developed for large data
stores. It implements a service-oriented architecture (SOA) to support
best practices established by archivists. Further, audits, such as by
the Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment
(DRAMBORA),[^42] may be conducted to assess how well repositories
implement trustworthy procedures.

Preservation and provenance metadata schemes such as PREMIS[^43] and
PROV-O[^44] are state-based ontologies that include entities such as
actors, events, and digital objects. They record the history of
transitions (e.g., changes in format) for digital objects.

**Rights Metadata:** For some data, there are many advantages to open
publication. The rights for that data can be specified with a Creative
Commons License. For other data, there can be strong justifications for
limited access, such as privacy and economic factors.

For example, although survey results are generally aggregated across
individuals, individual-level data is sometimes very useful. Some
repositories of survey data include micro-data, that is data for the
responses that individuals gave to survey questions.[^45] However,
analysis of such micro-data raises privacy concerns and needs to be
carefully managed; access should be limited to qualified researchers.
Repositories of individual health records raise similar privacy
concerns.

**Usage Statistics:** The number of visits and downloads for a dataset
can give an indication to later users about the likely value of a given
dataset. Such usage data are helpful for the managers and funders of
repositories to evaluate their service. Citations are indicators for how
a dataset is being used and its relationship to other work.

Analysis Platforms and Decision Support Systems
-----------------------------------------------

There is an increasingly rich set of analytic tools. Some of the
earliest tools were statistical packages such as SPSS, R, SAS, and
STATA. These were gradually enhanced with data visualization and other
analytic software. The current generation of tools such as Jupyter[^46],
RSpace, and eLab notebooks (ELN) integrate annotations, workflows, raw
data, data analysis, and annotations into one environment.

Virtual research environments (VREs) are typically organized by research
communities to coordinate datasets with search and analytic tools. For
instance, the Virtual Astronomy Observatory (VAO) uses Jupyter to
provide users with a robust research environment. WissKI[^47] is a
platform for coordinating digital humanities datasets which are based on
Drupal. Decision Support Systems (DSS) are generally focused on finding
optimal solutions in a parameter space. They often draw on data
warehouses though recently they have begun to incorporate feeds from
unstructured data (e.g., web searches).

Most repositories support search on metadata terms. In addition, some
repositories have developed their own powerful data exploration tools
such as ICPSR Colectica[^48] for DDI and the GSS Data Explorer[^49]. The
Amundsen data discovery and metadata engine[^50] uses metadata elements
to provide a table explorer. Potentially, interactive visualization
tools such as TableLens (Rao & Card, 1994) could also be employed.

Metadata Development, Standardization, and Management
-----------------------------------------------------

Metadata, whether for texts or datasets, needs to be complete,
consistent, standardized, machine processable, and timely (Park, 2009).
Metadata registries provide clear definitions and promote
standardization (ISO/IEC 11179). For instance, the Marine Metadata
Interoperability Ontology Registry and Repository[^51] records usage of
different metadata terms. A registry may interoperate with editing tools
for developers (Goncalves, O'Connor, et al., 2019). These tools may
suggest candidate metadata terms. One of the keys to the development of
good metadata is the involvement of a community that cares about the
results.

Data Cubes, Data Warehouses, and Data Exchanges
-----------------------------------------------

An organization such as a large business often has many different
databases. The data in the databases will likely have different formats
and definitions and can be organized in a multidimensional cube. Some of
cube's cells may be well-populated with data that appears across many of
the databases, but there will also be sparsely populated regions and
cells. Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) users can generate different
views of the data by drilling-down, rolling-up, and slicing-and-dicing
across cells. To facilitate retrieval, there can be a rich
pre-coordinated index for common queries. Other queries can be
implemented with slower methods such as hashing or B-trees.

While many organizations now have integrated enterprise data management
systems, data cubes are still useful for warehousing data and for
exchanging it across organizations. For instance, the W3C Data Cube[^52]
standard is applied in inter-organizational projects such as
EarthCube[^53]. *SDMX*[^54] *enables data exchange among statistical
agencies in the EU.*

Production Workflows, Research Workflows, and Research Objects
--------------------------------------------------------------

Entities change over time, yet many knowledge representation frameworks
do not model change. To represent change, models need to represent
transitions, processes, and other sequential activities. Such modeling
is closer to state machines, Petri Nets, process ontologies, the Unified
Modeling Language (UML) or even programming languages than to
traditional knowledge representation.

One way to document a research project is by saving files developed
during the study (Borycz & Carroll, 2018). Data files (e.g., Excel
files) are just one type of artifact from a research program; other
research objects include workflows. Workflows are a natural fit for
describing research methods and analyses (Austin, et al., 2017). The
Taverna[^55] workflow tool has been used for the MyExperiment[^56]
project. It provides a framework for capturing and posting Taverna and
other types of research workflows and incorporates simple ontologies
such as FOAF. Workflows can also be used to specify and document
statistical analyses; several of the analysis platforms described in
Section 7.2 support them. Sequential activities in the management of
repositories are often tracked with workflows. For instance, the Generic
Statistical Information Model (GSIM)[^57] specifies workflows for the
production of datasets by statistical agencies.

Semantic Modeling and Direct Representation
-------------------------------------------

Semantic models attempt to represent entities. They could support
unified descriptions of functionality, transitions of complex
continuants, and sequential activities (Allen, 2018). Changes in
semantic models are a form of qualitative simulation. While traditional
knowledge representation is usually implemented with ontologies, models
which allow transitions are more like programming languages. Although
semantic modeling might be implemented by process ontologies, we have
focused on the use of an object-oriented programming language which
supports threads to allow parallel concurrent event streams and
potentially to develop a "unified temporal map". Such semantic
simulations may be useful for modeling historical events. For instance,
a community described in a newspaper may be cast into a "community
model". These go beyond social ontology to model social mechanisms
(Ylikoski, in press).

In addition, Allen (2015, 2018) has proposed rich semantic modeling of
entire research reports and datasets. Structured evidence and
argumentation about claims might then be applied for the evaluation of
the models. Ultimately, such "direct representation" may replace text as
the primary representation for research and scholarship.

INFRASTRUCTURE
==============

Repository Servers
------------------

Semantic representations may be implemented with triplestores.
Triplestores facilitate logical inference, but retrieval may be more
efficient with relational databases. Many metadata catalogs are
implemented with relational databases. Thus, they use SQL and are often
characterized by UML Class Diagrams. Information models (e.g., National
Information Exchange Model (NIEM)[^58]) which could be used for metadata
registries may be implemented as data dictionaries.

Some repositories are federated with the Open Archives Initiative
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)[^59]. This allows the
"harvesting" of metadata from separate repositories. OAI-PMH is
increasingly used as an API to allow external users to query and
interact with the federated set of metadata.

Cloud Computing
---------------

We are well into the era of cloud computing (Foster & Gannon, 2017),
allowing flexible allocation of computing, networking and storage
resources, which facilitates Software as a Service (SaaS). The
compatibility of the versions of software packages needed for data
management is often a challenge. Containers, such as those from Docker,
allow compatible versions of software to be assembled and run on a
virtual computer. A cloud-based virtual machine can hold datasets,
workflows, and the programs used to analyze the data, which can be a
complete digital preservation package.

Highly networked data centers facilitate the Internet of Things (IoT)
which generates massive and dynamic data. Increasingly, cloud computing
is supporting edge computing and append-only stores which can capture
streaming data. These technologies will provide the foundation of smart
cities and have implications for the kinds of questions we may ask about
social behavior.

CONCLUSION
==========

Many datasets, especially legacy datasets, are difficult to find and
access. Some of the biggest issues for the retrieval of datasets concern
information organization, which helps to provide context. Metadata
supports the discovery and access to datasets.

More attention to metadata would also further support evidence-based
policy. We need richer, more systematic, and more interoperable metadata
standards. We need to improve the metadata associated with existing
datasets. And we need to aggressively upgrade the application of
high-quality metadata and knowledge organization systems to datasets as
they are created.

Introduction
============

The rich context competition was designed to inspire computer scientists
to automate the discovery of research datasets and the associated
research methods and fields in social science research publications.
Participants were asked to use any combination of machine learning and
data analysis methods to identify the datasets used in a corpus of
social science publications and infer both the scientific methods and
fields used in the analysis and the research fields.

The competition had the potential to draw on existing work. The IARPA
FUSE program had funded research teams to develop automated methods that
would identify technical emergence using information found in published
scientific, technical, and patent literature(*1*, *2*), and resulted in
recommendation systems like meta.com(*3*). Google Dataset Search had
developed search technologies that would find datasets in data
repositories across the Web(*4*) Academic social network sites like
ResearchGate and Academia.edu had developed platforms whereby
researchers provided feedback about their scientific activities(*5*) And
there is a well established tradition of competitions in computer
science, particularly natural language processing(*6*).

### Context

Social scientists might define rich context as a dataset search and
discovery process: what does the data **measure**, what **research** has
been done by which **researchers**, with what **code**, and with
what **results**. Computer scientists might define rich context as
knowledge graph representation and recommender systems. Others might
define rich context as promoting datasets to be a first class entity.
But the core idea of the competition was to incentivize computer
scientists to build automated tools that find datasets mentioned in
scientific publications and build an associated community of interest.
The results could then be used to recommend datasets to empirical
researchers and encourage researchers to provide feedback about the
value of the recommendations.

The innovation literature provided some guidance. At a high level, most
systematic incentives for innovation can be classified as one of two
types: up-front support for research ("push programs") or commitments to
reward successful results ("pull incentives")(*7*), with a given
incentive evaluated on its balance between positive and negative
outcomes. The patent system of protecting intellectual property for a
period of time, for example, is an incentive that balances the benefit
to the creator of time-limited exclusive use of a patented innovation
with the cost of restriction on broader use(*8*).

Prizes are another common pull incentive, offering direct reward for an
innovation that arises from competition among innovators. Innovation
prizes offer an immediate benefit that can be a powerful incentive for
development and diffusion of innovations, but the design of the contest
that awards them is important to maximizing innovation benefits, and
effective evaluation is difficult. For prizes to encourage innovations
that are of high quality, desirable, and more production-ready, the
contests that offer them need to be designed carefully to include
additional evaluation requirements or incentives, with the benefits to
participants carefully balanced so that the rewards make the additional
requirements worth their cost(*9*, *10*) .

The literature informing the development of a community of practice in a
domain of work where knowledge is cumulative emphasizes the advantages.
Successful communities can develop knowledge-sharing and dissemination
mechanisms, common norms of sharing and cooperation, and broad agreement
on technical paradigms and jargon(*11*). As open source software
communities show, however, they must be carefully incentivized and
nurtured to grow participation(*12*) and managed well to maintain
resources and quality of output over time(*13*).

### Specific Challenges

There were a number of challenges associated with developing a natural
language processing (NLP) competition applied academic publications.
Access to scientific publications is typically limited. In addition,
there are no existing annotated data sets or standards for annotations
and existing solutions are not easily reusable. A similar project
focused on text analysis for clinical studies reported that NLP research
teams do not traditionally collaborate closely, and models and systems
that result tend to not be designed or implemented to be easy to use or
to scale up for production use(*14*). However, in the NLP domain, Ian
Soboroff at the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST)
has developed a series of competition patterns designed to inspire
disparate groups of researchers to help to carry out information tasks
against text data. These include basic competitions where data is
provided to groups and they are allowed to train and then submit a
number of runs of their models against a subset of evaluation data
(*6*). More elaborate competitions include ones organized around an
"incident", where groups are given training data and model
specifications and allowed to train a model, game out an incident where
an event occurs in a previously unseen language and then they have to
quickly adapt their model to the new language and submit results(*15*).

We also wanted to encourage researchers to develop a generalized model
to identify datasets that was not overly dependent on the use of formal
titles of data sets, because many research datasets do not have such
formal titles. Thus the problem was much more complicated than a named
entity recognition problem, because competitors needed to be able to
characterize the language of discussing and using data to recognize
where data is discussed in a particular article and then identify which
data sets.

This chapter describes the implementation of the competition,
particularly focusing on the lessons learned.

Competition Design
==================

The goal of the competition was to use any combination of machine
learning and data analysis methods to identify the datasets mentioned in
a corpus of social science publications and infer both scientific
methods used in the analysis and the publication's research fields[^1].

The competition had two phases.

In the first phase, participating teams were provided with a listing of
datasets and a labeled corpus of 5,000 publications with an additional
dev fold of 100 publications. Each publication was labeled to indicate
which of the datasets from the master list were referenced within and
what specific text was used to refer to each dataset. The teams used
this data to train and tune algorithms to detect mentions of data in
publication text and, when a data set in our list is mentioned, tie each
mention to the appropriate data set. A separate corpus of 5,000 labeled
publications was held back to serve as an evaluation corpus. Each team
was allowed up to 2 test runs against this evaluation corpus before
final submission. The final models of each group were run against this
holdout corpus and the results were used to evaluate submissions, along
with a random qualitative review of the mentions, methods, and fields
detected by the team's model. Submissions were primarily scored on the
accuracy of techniques, the quality of documentation and code, the
efficiency of the algorithm, and the quality and novelty of the methods
and research fields inferred for each of the publications.

Four finalist teams were selected to participate in the second phase,
the teams from: Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, United
States; GESIS at the University of Mannheim, Germany; Paderborn
University, Germany; and KAIST in South Korea.

In the second phase, finalists were provided with a new training corpus
of 5000 unlabeled publications and asked to discover which of the
datasets from the first phase's data catalog were used in each
publication, as well as infer associated research methods and fields. As
in the first phase, teams were scored on the accuracy of their
techniques, the quality of their documentation and code, the efficiency
of their algorithm, and the quality and novelty of the methods and
research fields inferred for each of the publications.

At the end of each phase, competing teams packaged their models into a
docker container using a model packaging framework designed and built
for the competition by NYU, and the containers were installed on AWS
servers and run by the competition organizers against the holdout to
generate predictions that were used to evaluate the teams.

Data
====

For training and evaluation data, our goal was to lay the foundations
for developing a "gold standard corpus" (GSC) of academic populations
tagged with the semantic context within which datasets are mentioned
used in analysis. A GSC corpus is one that is manually tagged and
reviewed for quality, usually for a particular domain and task. Creating
one is time-consuming and expensive(*16*) because it involves selecting
a corpus to annotate, then implementing a manual annotation and review
scheme[^2].

While our goal was not to make a GSC, we used our data creation to begin
to assess data needed for high quality data detection models and to test
potential methods for creating a GSC. To create our competition training
and evaluation data, we started with data set citation data from the
ICPSR data catalog
([[https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/]{.underline}](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)),
then used methods that originated in quantitative content analysis of
communication artifacts(*17*) combined with software designed to reduce
and simplify the work of human coders to increase reliability (*18*).

In each of the two phases, competing teams were given text and metadata
for 5,000 publications and single set of metadata on 10,348 data sets of
interest, shared between the two phases, for use in training and testing
their models. Separate 5,000-publication samples were provided for each
phase. The corpus of 10,348 data sets included data maintained by
Deutsche Bundesbank and the set of public data sets hosted by the
Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).
In addition, a single 100-publication development fold was provided
separate from the training and testing data to serve as a test for
packaging of each team's model, and as a quick test of their model and
the quality of its output[^3].

In each phase, an additional separate set of 5,000 publications were
held back and used to evaluate the models. After the 1st phase, the
phase 1 holdout was also provided to phase 2 competitors to serve as
additional training and testing data.

In phase 1, both the train-test publications and the holdout
publications were broken into 2,500 publications each that used one or
more of the data sets of interest for analysis, as compiled by ICPSR and
Bundesbank staff, and 2,500 publications that had not been annotated and
had been filtered to not contain data. The data set citations were
captured in a separate data set citations JSON file. The citations for
the phase 1 train-test publications were provided to competition teams
to use as training data, while the citations in the phase 1 holdout were
used to test the quality of each team's model in phase 1, and given to
teams as additional training data in phase 2.

In phase 2, teams were provided with the phase 1 holdout for additional
annotated training data, and then provided with an additional
un-annotated set of 5,000 publications to assess their model's behavior
on un-curated data. The phase 2 holdout of 5,000 publications was also
unannotated, and evaluation of data set detection was based on
hand-coded data set reference data revised to make the data more
representative of what the models were asked to detect.

Publications
------------

All publication text provided to teams was either open access, and so
freely available, or licensed from the publisher for use in the contest
by contest participants. In each phase of the competition, a set of
publications was provided to the participants and a separate set of
publications was held out and kept in reserve so it could be used to
evaluate the teams' models. For each publication, participants were
provided with PDF and plain text versions of each publication along with
basic metadata (pub\_date; unique\_identifier - DOI or equivalent;
text\_file\_name; pdf\_file\_name; and publication\_id - the unique
identifier from our internal system used to manage the data, metadata,
and underlying relationships between publications and data sets for the
competition).

One particular challenge was that copyright and licensing around
research publications limited what publications could be accessed,
licensed, and distributed for the competition, and so our universe of
publications was limited to publications that were either open access,
or published by Sage Publications.

### Publication Dataset - Phase 1

-   2500 labeled training publications

-   2500 unlabeled/no-dataset training publications

-   100 publication development fold

-   2500 labeled holdout publications

-   2500 unlabeled/no-dataset holdout publications

In phase 1, 5,000 publications were provided to participants as a
train-test data set, 5,000 publications were held back for evaluation,
and 100 publications were provided as a separate development fold, for
basic model testing and evaluation. The train-test and evaluation
holdout each contained 2,500 publications that cited at least one data
set, and 2,500 publications that had not been cited by ICPSR as using
their data, and had been filtered to not have obvious markers of using
data.

The annotated portion of these two sets of publications were drawn from
a set of publications provided by Bundesbank that referenced their data
and the publications captured in the ICPSR catalog annotated as having
used a particular data set for analysis. These publications were
collected in a database application designed to facilitate a mix of
human and automated content analysis of publications. They were then
filtered into two sets: those that were open access, and so could be
shared publicly, and those that were not open access, but that were
available from our publisher partner (Sage Publications, or "Sage"). Of
the 5,100 total publications with annotated data citations provided to
phase 1 participants, the 2,550 publications in the train-test corpus
(2,500) and development fold (50) were randomly selected from the open
access set, so they could be distributed freely to all participants. The
2,500 in the holdout were randomly selected from the remainder of the
open access set plus those available from Sage. The un-annotated
publications used in phase 1 were all published by Sage - the 2,550
non-annotated publications in the train-test corpus (2,500) and
development fold (50) were open access publications from Sage journals.
The 2,500 un-annotated publications used in the holdout evaluation
corpus were sampled from across Sage Publications' journal holdings
including non-open access journals.

### Publication Dataset - Phase 2

-   The main publication corpus for phase 2 of the competition was
    10,000 unlabeled publications evenly distributed between 6 key topic
    areas (Education, Health care, Agriculture, Finance, Criminal
    justice, and Welfare), nicknamed the "wild corpus".

-   5,000 of these 10,000 were given to teams to work with in phase 2
    (randomly selected from within each of the 6 key topic areas to
    maintain even distribution across topic areas).

-   The other 5,000 publications were held out to serve as an evaluation
    corpus.

-   In addition, teams were given the same 100 publication development
    fold as in phase 1.

-   Teams were given the 5,000 publication evaluation corpus from phase
    1 to serve as further train-test data.

In phase 2, we worked with Sage to find publications in six key topic
areas of interest for partners and future projects (Education, Health
care, Agriculture, Finance, Criminal justice, and Welfare). For 28,769
matches, Sage provided PDFs for each and we parsed the text (see details
below), removing any that did not parse, or that resulted in file sizes
smaller than 20KB, reducing the size of the sample to 25,888. We looked
at publication year and type to see if we needed to filter out older
publications or non-academic publications, but there were few enough of
each class (644 pre-2000 publications and 3,115 non-research articles)
that we decided we'd keep all in to preserve as much potential for
heterogeneity as possible. From these 25,888 publications, we then
randomly selected a total of 10,000 with the goal to keep the
distribution across the 6 topic areas equal (so 1666 randomly selected
in 2 topic areas, 1667 randomly selected in the other 4). Then, we split
the phase 2 corpus to give half to participants and keep half back for
evaluation, maintaining equal distribution between the topic areas
within each set of 5,000 publications.

### Converting PDF files to plain text

The plain text provided for each publication was derived from that
publication's PDF file by the competition organizers. It was not
intended to be a gold standard, but to serve as an option in case a team
preferred not to allocate resources to PDF parsing.

The articles were converted from PDF to text using the open source
"pdftotext" application, an Xpdf text extraction system. The basic
conversion used the "raw" mode of "pdftotext":

pdftotext -raw \<path\_to\_pdf.pdf\> \<path\_to\_txt.txt\>

There are many approaches and tools available for this task. The
rationale behind this simplified process for converting pdfs to texts:

1.  To render the most usable txt files from available pdfs without over
    engineering for any specific types of pdf files (e.g., single column
    vs. multi-column).

2.  To have a process that is easily reproducible across different
    machines for free. That is, not all PDFs convert the same way. Some
    are more error prone than others. More advanced OCR techniques might
    have been able to compensate where Xpdf might have fallen short, but
    relying on more sophisticated and perhaps costly text conversion
    processes would have made the conversion pipeline more expensive to
    reproduce and less portable across different applications.

Because of the basic approach, there were some limitations to note:

-   Many artifacts from PDF formatting were left behind in the text.

-   We had to tweak our processing to get multi-column layouts to output
    text in order in a linear, single-column text output, and the method
    we ended up using to achieve this precluded more nuanced processing
    of other elements of the PDFs.

-   Example: tables and charts were not converted in any way to text.

Competition participants were encouraged to try their own conversion
process if this text did not meet their needs. If participant teams
chose to use another means for converting PDF files to plain text, we
asked that they supply us with documentation for installing and running
their conversion process so we could start to build up a set of PDF
processing strategies that could be reused in the future.

Finding Data Sets
-----------------

Competitors were provided with two sets of data related to detecting
data sets: 1) a catalog of all of the data sets of interest that models
were tasked with finding in publications, including basic metadata for
all and a list of verbatim mention text snippets for those that were
cited in the train-test data; and 2) a subset of these data sets that
were actually specifically annotated as having been used for analysis in
a given publication.

The data set catalog, provided to participants in the JSON file
data\_sets.json, contained metadata for all public datasets in the ICPSR
data repository and a subset of public data sets available from Deutsche
Bundesbank. It includes all data sets sited in the train-test and
evaluation corpora, plus many others not cited in either. The data was
provided in JSON format for ease of use, a JSON list of JSON objects,
each of which contains:

-   subjects - list of terms associated with the dataset, based on the
    [[ICPSR subject
    thesaurus.]{.underline}](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/thesaurus/subject)

-   additional\_keywords - System keyword for where dataset originated.

-   citation - Preferred dataset citation.

-   data\_set\_id - Integer ID for dataset from our internal data store
    of publications, data sets, and relations. This is the identifier
    used in the data\_set\_citations.json file to identify relationships
    between datasets and publications.

-   title - Canonical title for dataset.

-   name - Canonical title for dataset.

-   description - Dataset description, if available.

-   unique\_identifier - Original unique identifier for dataset,
    normally a DOI if available.

-   methodology - Methodology for dataset, if available.

-   date - Date when dataset was published, if available.

-   coverages - Geographic coverages, if available.

-   family\_identifier - Internal system ID, roughly captures datasets
    that have multiple years but are the same dataset. Inconsistently
    applied, should not be used in analysis.

-   mention\_list - Array of strings for annotated mentions as
    identified by human reviewers. Not an exhaustive list of mentions
    for any given dataset, and only populated for those data sets cited
    in the phase 1 train-test corpus.

The mention list is the superset of all unique mention strings
associated with each data set across all of that data set's citations
where mention data was created. Mention data was only created for data
sets cited in the phase 1 train-test corpus.

ICPSR captured when a given data set was used in analysis within a
particular publication, but it did not capture particulars on how that
determination was made. To provide better data for participants, we
implemented a human content analysis protocol to capture mention text
for each data set-publication pair included in our train-test corpus
(see [[Data Set Mention Annotation Process]{.underline}](#_23ckvvd)
below). Since we manually created this data, given limited time and
resources, we initially only did this work for data sets that the teams
would be using for training and testing in phase 1. In future work, we
intend to provide this kind of information for all data sets of
interest, and to refine the protocol to capture the exact position in
the text of each mention along with the verbatim text.

Citations of data sets by publications within our phase 1 corpora were
captured in separate data\_set\_citations.json files for each of the
train-test and evaluation corpora. Each of these JSON files contains a
JSON list of JSON objects, each of which specifics a single relationship
between a data set and a publication. This JSON format is also used by
models to output detected citations. Each citation contains:

-   citation\_id - A unique ID for the relationship between one dataset
    and one publication

-   publication\_id - Unique ID for a publication which is the same ID
    for the publication in publications.json

-   data\_set\_id - Unique ID for a dataset which is the same ID for the
    dataset in the data\_sets.json file.

-   mention\_list - Optional array of strings for alternative references
    for the dataset in the specific publication (only present in
    citations included in train-test corpus, and even then, could still
    be empty).

-   score - Confidence score for the dataset being found in the related
    publication. In ICPSR-specified citations, the score will be 1.0. In
    model-created files, will depend on the model.

Even citations from the phase 1 train-test corpus could have an empty
mentions list. A given publication could, for example, have been tagged
with a dataset by the curator (either at Bundesbank or ICPSR) based on
knowledge of the publication and dataset, but a human coder without this
knowledge was not subsequently able to find specific mentions within the
publication, or the human coder could simply have missed the references.
An empty mentions list is not a guarantee that the data set in question
was not mentioned.

The list of data sets cited in a particular publication is also not
exhaustive. There is the possibility that other data sets from our
catalog of data sets of interest were used in analysis within a paper
but not captured. The ICPSR data did not include mentions where data was
not used in analysis, even of other ICPSR data sets. And named data sets
not within our catalog of data sets of interest could also have been
used in analysis within a given publication.

### Data Set Mention Annotation Process

The ICPSR data contains many explicit ties between publications and data
sets that would have been hard to come by otherwise, but the lack of any
indication of which parts of the publication indicated the citation
relationship made it difficult to identify the linguistic context within
the publication that captured the relationship.

To make it easier for participants in the competition to efficiently and
systematically engage with the language used to discuss data, we
developed a content analysis protocol and accompanying web-based coding
application so human coders could examine all of the data set citations
in our train-test corpus and capture mention text for each. This
required human workers to examine each data set citation in the context
of its publication (there were X citations in 2500 training
publications) to identify and mark locations in the text where each data
set was referenced.

Because of the manual effort required, we only did this for the 2,500
train-test publications that referenced data provided to the teams. We
did not manually annotate mention text in the 2,500 publications in the
phase 1 holdout, and this made that data a little less useful for teams
when it was given to them in phase 2.

Our team of coders was spread across the United States, and so we used a
web-based application with a central database store to allow our
distributed team of coders to work in parallel. The basic unit of work
was a publication-data set pair (so a given publication would be
examined as many times as it had different data sets cited within it).

The ICPSR data set repository is very fine-grained in definition of a
data set, so each year of an ongoing survey, for example, might have its
own data set. To save time, we eventually created the concept of a data
set family for these types of data sets and assigned coding for any one
instance in a family to all other instances from that family within a
given publication. So, for example, multiple years of the same survey or
longitudinal data collection were related to each other in a family, and
then coding for one year within a paper was used for all other years
cited in that paper.

The general process:

-   each user was assigned a list of citations to code.

-   Once the user logged in to the coding tool, they were presented with
    a list of the coding tasks assigned to them that included a status
    of each, so they could track which they had already completed, and a
    link for each to the coding page.

-   Once the user loads a particular citation for coding, they are
    presented with the following coding page, and are asked to follow
    the coding instructions in the codebook/documentation for the
    annotation tool
    ([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuZL\_-z1re6TO3Sv8\_9tdFk7z6ovyqTwDVgc1bYO3Ag/edit]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuZL_-z1re6TO3Sv8_9tdFk7z6ovyqTwDVgc1bYO3Ag/edit)):

Coders were instructed to find terms that relate to mentions of the
dataset and avoid general synonyms of those terms (for example, tagging
"[ANS survey]{.underline}" instead of only "[survey]{.underline}"). If
the phrase provides additional information about collection of the
dataset, the mention is tagged twice. For example, in the case of "[ANS
survey collected/conducted by X]{.underline}", "[ANS
survey]{.underline}" is captured first, and then "[ANS survey
collected/conducted by X]{.underline}". At the same time, we tried to
avoid including too much descriptive information of the dataset - the
task is just to code the specific mentions of a particular dataset,
including alternate names (e.g. abbreviations, etc.), rather than trying
to capture full text in which the data set is discussed.

For more details, including an FAQ that provides guidance on specific
issues that arose during coding (like how to deal with data sets that
span multiple years), see the content analysis protocol:
[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuZL\_-z1re6TO3Sv8\_9tdFk7z6ovyqTwDVgc1bYO3Ag/edit]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuZL_-z1re6TO3Sv8_9tdFk7z6ovyqTwDVgc1bYO3Ag/edit)

In total, a team of 5 coders, with a background in text analytics for
policy research and computational linguistics, completed the task (Emily
Wiegand, Neil Miller and Jenna Chapman from Chapin Hall at the
University of Chicago, Mengxuan Zhao, Marcos Ynoa and Ekaterina
Levitskaya from the CUNY Graduate Center, Computational Linguistics
program). The results were then used to re-render data\_sets.json and
the data\_set\_citations.json file for the phase 1 train-test data to
include mentions.

This combined protocol and tool were developed in-house. Considerations
behind building in-house:

-   From previous work, we had an open-source tool that did what we
    would need with minor tweaks, so were able to leverage substantial
    existing work, though we did have to pay for the work to customize
    it as well as the AWS t2.large instance on which we hosted it.

-   This tool includes templates for human-coding application pages like
    the one we used, but it is also designed to be used to build up data
    about publications from multiple sources and this data is
    straightforward to query and interact with. This allowed us to use
    the underlying database and application code as the competition
    dataset database, not just a place to handle mention coding.

-   We looked at off-the-shelf text annotators and Qualitative Analysis
    tool such as lighttag.io, tag.works, NVivo, Atlas.ti, MAXQDA.
    Unfortunately, given a tight timeline and relatively complex
    requirements, we didn't have the time to come up to speed with any
    of these tools. In addition, we needed the tool to be usable by a
    distributed team, and that precluded some tools above that did not
    support distributed workflows.

-   For future coding work, we would love to be able to outsource coding
    tool development, and so are looking at distributed coding
    applications like lighttag.io and tag.works.

Methods and Fields
------------------

For the task of detecting methods and fields for a given publication,
our goals were broader than simply providing a vocabulary for each and
asking the teams to classify publications against them. We want to
encourage development of models that not only can determine when a given
publication is a part of an existing field or uses an existing method,
but that also understands enough about fields and methods such that they
can be used to detect new fields and methods as they emerge, and can
then be used to look back through time for traces of these new fields
and methods to track their growth and evolution.

To support this goal, we did not give any formal set of either methods
or fields that participants needed to train models to classify from.
Instead, we provided examples of taxonomies of methods and fields that
Sage Publications uses to classify their publications[^4], and we
directed participants to use them as an example, but to try to make
models that would be more creative and potentially able to find new,
emerging, or novel fields rather than just fit a publication to a term
from a predefined taxonomy.

In practice, this decision to forego any kind of fitting to an existing
taxonomy showed the complexity of the problem of understanding fields
and methods well enough to detect them based on linguistic context,
rather than classifying to an existing vocabulary. Some teams limited
themselves to the vocabularies we defined, and the results were
uninspiring. Some teams tried to detect based on text, but ended up with
a lot of noise and few relevant terms.

In addition, we also learned that there is complexity in "methods" that
lumping all methods together did not account for: methods could mean
many things, and we started to find sub-categories that we wish we had
broken this into: statistical methods, analysis methods, data collection
and creation methods, etc.

For future work, for each of these types of information, we intend to
first work to decide what exactly we mean by "fields" and "methods",
then find or develop one or more taxonomies to precisely capture what we
mean. Once we have these taxonomies, we'll focus separately on building
models to classify publications to them, and making models to extend and
update them.

Submission Process
==================

The primary goals of the submission process developed for our
competition were:

-   to balance the effort needed for a particular group of participants
    to package their model for submission with the effort needed from
    the competition organizers to configure, run, and troubleshoot
    submissions once they were received.

-   to begin development of a model packaging strategy that could be
    used to distribute and allow reuse of any model that uses it.

More specifically, we had the following requirements:

-   Create submission infrastructure to make it as straightforward and
    easy as possible for a team to package their model for submission,
    including minimizing the understanding needed to use technologies
    chosen for packaging and deployment and having a built-in way to
    automatically run the model over the dev fold to validate processing
    of standard input formats and creation of required output formats.

-   Minimize the installation and configuration work needed on part of
    competition organizers to replicate computing environments as part
    of model submission process.

-   Maximize our ability to see and be able to test how each submission
    environment is set up, and so avoid accepting a blackbox that could
    contain anything (including malicious code or sneaky/clever tricks).

Building and Submitting a Model
-------------------------------

Our approach for participants building and submitting a model combines
Box.com, docker, a git repo for code to implement and support
infrastructure, and shell scripts. The central workspace for competition
participants was a Box folder that contained example docker files, a
copy of the dev fold, and shell scripts that implemented the basic steps
of packaging, building, running, and testing a model. The git repository
([[https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition]{.underline}](https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition))
was integral to our framework, but was not used directly by
participants. Its code repository was solely used as a home for the
code, scripts, and files that made up our submission framework. We did,
however, host documentation for participants in the repository's main
README and its wiki
([[https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition/wiki]{.underline}](https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition/wiki)).

To get started, participants downloaded a compressed archive of the Box
folder and extracted it onto a system with a bash shell. Windows systems
were supported, but we recommended that participants with Windows
machines work inside a linux virtual machine.

This work folder contained:

-   the script "rcc.sh" and its accompanying configuration "config.sh",
    that implements all of the basic actions needed to manage docker for
    a model.

-   A set of scaffold files and folders that demonstrate how to hook a
    model into a docker container, including a Dockerfile with examples
    of installing OS packages and python packges in a docker container
    and an example "project" folder with a "code.sh" shell script that
    is called by default when the docker container is run,
    pre-configured to call a provided example python file named
    "project.py".

-   A copy of the git repo, for use by the scripts.

-   A copy of the dev fold, in the standard data folder structure.

The set of scaffold files provided out of the box could be used along
with "rcc.sh" to create a simple docker container to test one's local
install of docker (including reading from and writing to a data folder
configure in "config.sh", running a script in the work folder, and
creating output).

Participants were then instructed to work within the "project" folder in
their work folder, get their code working first on their local machine,
then set up a docker container using the provided example files and get
the model running there, to isolate problems with docker from problems
with their model.

When participants were ready to submit, they were asked to compress
their work folder and upload it to the root of their group's project
folder and send an email to the organizers.

Participants were allowed 2 test submissions before the final
submission, and most groups took us up on those test submissions in
phases 1 and 2. All groups were able to work within the "code.sh" and
"project.py" files in "project" to get their model to run, so no further
customizations were needed.

Model API
---------

Our submission framework used a file-system based API for giving the
model input and accepting output. We interaction through the file system
to keep the configuration and implementation simple.

Each time the docker container for a model is run, it is configured to
work in a particular data folder.

This data folder has a standard directory structure:

data  
  |  _input  
  |   |  _files  
  |   |  _text  
  |   |  _pdf  
\|\_output

All input information is stored in the "data/input" folder. All output
is expected to be stored in the "data/output" folder.The input folder
will contain a \"publications.json\" file, with the same contents as
described above in the "Data → Publications" section of this chapter,
that lists the articles to be processed in the current run of the model.
Publication plain text is stored in "data/input/files/text", one text
file to a publication, with a given publication\'s text named
\"\<publication\_id\>.txt\". The original PDF files are stored in
"data/input/files/pdf", one PDF file to a publication, with a given
publication\'s text named \"\<publication\_id\>.pdf\".

The output folder starts out empty, and is where the model is expected
to place 4 output files after each run of the model:

-   **data\_set\_citations.json** - A JSON file that contains
    publication-dataset pairs for each detected mention of any of the
    data sets provided in the contest data\_sets.json file. The JSON
    file should contain a JSON list of objects, where each object
    represents a single publication-dataset pair.

-   **data\_set\_mentions.json** - A JSON file that should contain a
    list of JSON objects, where each object contains a single
    publication-mention pair for every data set mention detected within
    each publication, regardless of whether a gvien data set is one of
    the data sets provided in the contest data set file.

-   **methods.json** - A JSON file that should contain a list of JSON
    objects, where each object captures publication-method pairs.

-   **research\_fields.json** - A JSON file that should contain a list
    of JSON objects, where each object captures publication-research
    field pairs.

Running a Submitted Model
-------------------------

Once a model was submitted, the competition organizers followed a
standard script for running the model and processing its output for
analysis:

-   For each submission, an AWS instance was spun up from a standard
    image pre-configured to run models built using our submission
    framework.

-   The evaluator connected to the instance and started a screen
    session, so work would not be disrupted if connection to server was
    lost.

-   The model was downloaded to the server and extracted.

-   The submission container was built on the server using the provided
    Dockerfile and "rcc.sh", and then the container was run over the dev
    fold to test basic functionality of the container and the model, and
    to give an estimate of time needed to complete.

-   Once the dev fold was successfully processed, "config.sh" was
    reconfigured to point at the evaluation corpus, and the model was
    run over the evaluation corpus.

-   Once the model completed, standard evaluation Jupyter notebooks in
    the git submission framework repository were configured to the
    current projects output and run to generate materials for judges to
    evaluate the submission.

-   Output and results were copied to a central storage area, and the
    instance used to run the model was terminated.

Throughout this process, the evaluator communicated any problems with
the participant team and worked with the team to address problems and
turn around a new version of the model as quickly as possible. If a
team's model performed poorly on the standard size machine, we also
would sometimes try different sizes of server to give them an idea of
whether their problem was related to needing more compute power, or was
a limitation of their approach independent of available resources.

Notes on the Submission Process
-------------------------------

We chose Box.com because we have unlimited space there through NYU, and
so we were able to accommodate not only whatever data participants
needed to provide to make their models work, but also all of the data we
provided to participants for training and testing. To minimize
confusion, we pre-configured and shared each team's Box folder with
them, so they did not have to do any setup.

To setup the infrastructure in each folder, we created a git repository
(https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition) that
contained all of the files, shell scripts, and templates needed to: 1)
configure a new instance of a team folder, for use by competition staff
setting up team folders; 2) develop, package and test deployment of a
model (participants); and 3) support building, running, and evaluating
the models once they were submitted.

We considered using github to store participant submissions, but chose
Box because of its unlimited storage.

We considered using an external service like CodaLab or Kaggle, but an
initial assessment of each suggested that they would not meet our needs
without substantial changes to the design of our competition:

-   Codalab looked promising, but its documentation was sparse and our
    time frame was short enough that we weren't comfortable we could get
    up to speed with it quickly enough to make a reliable, easy-to-use
    competition with it.

-   Kaggle seemed designed for more basic competition designs (our
    evaluation steps were fuzzy, so couldn't just take their outputs and
    make scores - this is not entirely a knock on them - it would be
    great to get our tasks to the point where they fit in this
    framework, we just don't have the data yet), and there were also
    licensing complications we weren't comfortable sorting out. We also
    needed control over manual evaluation and were concerned there that
    their submission and evaluation system wouldn't support the bespoke
    nature of our submissions.

-   For both, we also simply weren't comfortable that we'd be able to
    get up to speed on the platform in time to make the experience of
    participating in the competition as pleasant and painless as
    possible.

We also wanted to have the flexibility to run many models in parallel
and give models substantial resources if needed, to see how they
performed with different magnitudes of computing resources and to allow
us to try to throw raw compute power at a model if it was running too
slowly, to get it to complete so we could give as good of feedback as
possible. We not only wanted groups to be able to do preliminary
submissions, but we wanted to make sure we could give as much feedback
as possible. This led us toward a container-based approach where we did
what we could to abstract and simplify the running of models, and
allowed for flexibility and configurability in the instances that we
spun up to run the models.

Evaluation
==========

In both phases of the competition, we evaluated raw mentions, research
fields, and research methods separate from citation of named data sets.

Phase 1 Evaluation
------------------

### Mentions, Methods and Fields

In phase 1, expert social science judges evaluated mentions, methods,
and fields in two ways: 1) we randomly selected 10 publications to
manually examine each team's output against, and made notes of good and
bad for each team, then ranked the teams within each publication; and 2)
we generated distributions of all values found across all publications
within each type of value, counted the occurrences of each, compared the
distributions across teams, and ranked the teams based on how their
distributions compared. To create overall rankings, the judges met,
compared notes and individual rankings, and then agreed on an overall
ranking of the teams.

### Data Set Citations

To evaluate data set citations in phase 1, we used the ICPSR citation
data as our evaluation baseline for creating a confusion matrix based on
how each team's citation findings compared to ICPSR's baseline, and we
calculated precision, recall, and F1 scores from the confusion matrix to
compare across teams. To create the confusion matrix for each team, we
started with a list of all of the data set-publication pairs found
either in ICPSR's baseline or the team's output. We created found-or-not
(1 or 0) vectors for every publication-data set pair for the baseline,
and for the team. Then, for each data set-publication pair, we compared
the values between the baseline vector and the team vector to decide how
to update the confusion matrix for that pair: if a team agreed with
ICPSR on presence of a data set, that was counted as a true positive
(TP). If the team found a data set that ICPSR did not, that was counted
as a false positive (FP). If a team missed a data set ICPSR indicated
was present, it was counted as a false negative (FN). We did not develop
a way to capture true negatives since the metrics we used to evaluate
did not require it. In addition, as part of the processing to create the
overall confusion matrix, we created per-publication confusion matrices
for each publication, so we could track average false positives and
false negatives per publication, and highlight publications that were
higher than the average, for more detailed evaluation.

We also deferred figuring out "mentioned" vs. "used in analysis" in our
initial competition, to make the initial task more manageable. This
decision, combined with the traits of the ICPSR data, caused substantial
noise in the phase 1 precision/recall/F1 scores. For example, even
models that figured out that a longitudinal data set was present
sometimes got many false positives and false negatives because they got
the years wrong, and models that correctly found ICPSR data sets used in
discussion had those counted as false positives because ICPSR had only
captured data sets used in analysis.

Phase 2 Evaluation
------------------

In evaluating phase 2, we kept the division between mentions, fields,
and methods and citations, but we refined our evaluation methods in
based on what we'd learned in the first phase.

Mentions, Methods and Fields

For mentions, methods, and fields in phase 2, we kept the basic strategy
of: 1) comparing the values created by each team's model in the context
of a set of selected publications and 2) reviewing the overall
distributions of values for each team.

We expanded the number of publications across which we compared values
to make the sample reviewed more representative, though, and created a
web-based tool to help judges deal with the added work from more
publications to review. We also selected publications differently for
data mentions from fields and methods, choosing publications with
different levels of agreement between the teams on whether data was
present or not, to start to evaluate the different model's ability to
detect data at all, in addition to comparing the results when they
thought a publication contained data.

For fields and methods (and data set citations), we selected 20
publications for each of our 6 topic areas of interest (Education,
Health care, Agriculture, Finance, Criminal justice, and Welfare) with a
few extras (2 extra in finance and 1 extra in criminal justice), for a
total of 123 publications to compare values across. Within the 20
publications per topic area, we worked through a random selection of
articles picking publications to add to our sample to fill out a rough
ratio within each topic area of 5:4:1 between publications with titled
data sets (5); data described, but not titled (4); and no data (1).

To make it easier for the judges to work through this increased number
of publications, we also created a tool that collected the output for
each team side-by-side per publication along with a link to each
publication's PDF, and had a place for the judge to score each team's
output for a given publication from among "-1", "0", and "1". Once
judges scored all output, we then created rankings based on the sum of
each team's scores.

*Figure 2: The interface given to judges to evaluate data set mentions,
research fields, and research methods.*

For manual evaluation of data set mentions, we used the same tool
described above, but we chose a different sample of 60 publications
based on agreement between the output of the different participant team
models as to whether publications had data mentions. To generate this
sample, we first loaded all of the output from each team's model into
our work database. We then made a list of all of the publications in our
phase 2 holdout and, for each publication, the count of teams that had
data set mentions for that publication. We then sampled to get 60
publications:

-   10 publications where all teams agreed there was no data.

-   10 publications where all teams agreed there was data.

-   40 publications where the teams disagreed on whether there was data.

For the 40 publications with disagreement, we selected publications with
1 team, 2 teams, and 3 teams agreeing data was present proportional to
the distribution of each level of agreement in the broader sample:

-   17 from 1 (1439/5000 = 0.2878; 0.2878 \* 60 = 17.268)

-   20 from 2 (1741/5000 = 0.3482; 0.3482 \* 60 = 20.892)

-   13 from 3 (1080/5000 = 0.216; 0.216 \* 60 = 12.96)

We then asked a separate pair of qualitative judges to use the tool to
compare and evaluate the data set mentions generated by the teams across
these publications.

### Data Set Citations

Our analysis of data set citations in phase 2 required a more
substantial rethinking since we did not have any starting point for
presence or absence of data like the ICPSR corpus. We implemented a
method of creating a confusion matrix that could be used to generate
precison, recall, and F1 scores more closely aligned with the task we'd
assigned the teams to implement - finding mentions of data and data sets
within publications.

To implement this, we started with the sample of 123 publications used
for evaluating mentions and fields above and:

-   Captured all "data references" within each of those publications
    using a new human coding protocol. This included external titled
    data sets either discussed or used in analysis, external data
    without a title that was discussed or used in analysis, and data
    created by the researcher for a given study.

-   For each data reference, we compared all mentions and citations
    created by each team for the publication to the information on the
    data reference within that publication and marked any that were
    "related" to the data reference.

-   Finally, we used the list of references as a baseline and built a
    confusion matrix based on whether each team had found mentions or
    citations "related" to each of the data references, along with a
    "false positive" record where the baseline was always 0 and the team
    was assigned a 1 if they had one or more mentions or citations that
    were not "related" to any data reference.

#### Capturing Data References

To capture data references in our sample of publications, we created a
basic protocol for an initial round of data creation
([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFPEtT4hd93kcsOEzocyB6-a4Hu8WcemKTld-98Q25k/edit\#heading=h.f3u3kdbg87s4]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFPEtT4hd93kcsOEzocyB6-a4Hu8WcemKTld-98Q25k/edit#heading=h.f3u3kdbg87s4)),
then evaluated the results throughout the rest of the process. We used a
single data reference coder to encourage consistency in output. Our data
reference coder worked within a spreadsheet to, for each publication in
our sample:

-   Flag all paragraphs where data was mentioned.

-   Cluster mentions together that refer to a single dataset.

-   Give each cluster of mentions a row in the spreadsheet. These are
    our "data references".

-   Then, for each data reference:

    -   Collect all mentions that refer to the reference.

    -   decide if the data set is simply cited ("cited"), or if it is
        one used in analysis ("analysis") in the publication

    -   Capture words or phrases that are key to identification as "key
        terms".

    -   Also capture any broader contextual text in "Context", so it
        could be used to better understand the nature of the "data
        reference".

    -   If data set title is present, capture it.

    -   Try looking up the data set in the database, and if it is there,
        store its data set ID.

We tried to capture detailed context on each reference for a couple
reasons: 1) To make it easier for reviewers of this data to evaluate the
quality of each data reference; 2) To give more context for judges
deciding if mentions and citations for a given team were "related" to a
given data reference.

#### Finding Related Mentions and Citations

After the data references were captured, a team of coders then looked at
each data reference related to the selected publications for each team
to see if data set citations and mentions by the team were "related" to
the data reference.

The coders, subject matter experts in the different key topic areas,
looked at each "data reference" in publications in their area of
expertise. For each, they evaluated it against the mentions and
citations output by the model of each team that found mentions or
citations in the selected publication. For each reference-team pair, the
coder flagged any mentions or citations they deemed "related to" the
current data reference.

In our protocol
([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hi13N6gfiRz9nfwCoUQrey8v\_ozY7fKHMtHV4GgX2ys/edit\#]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hi13N6gfiRz9nfwCoUQrey8v_ozY7fKHMtHV4GgX2ys/edit)),
we describe the coding task as "When you are judging data mentions, we
want to mark mentions on the right as "exists" if they are related to
the data referenced on the left, and make sure to not mark any mentions
as \"exists\" that are not related.", balanced with "If in doubt, don't
mark a given mention as related."

The definition of "related to" is purposely fuzzy. Our goal was to give
credit for finding language related to a dataset even if it wasn't a
perfect, formal reference, but to also make sure to not mark things that
are obviously unrelated. To help to flesh this distinction out, we gave
examples and analogies and training, and we had coders work through a
few data references on their own then discuss their decisions.

An example from the protocol: "Think of it as a fuzzy match - we want to
give the models the benefit of the doubt if they get close, especially
if they detect some but not all key terms or phrases or find a mention
of the basic type of data a named data set represents ("wage data" for
IDES Unemployment Wage Records, for example), but we also want to make
sure to reject things that are obviously not related."

Coders used a web-based coding tool that listed out their assigned
coding tasks and pulled together all of the information so they just had
to scan the page, open the associated PDF if they had questions, and
then mark related items and Submit to save their coding:

![](combined_images/chap05_figure3.png){width="6.5in" height="5.013888888888889in"}

*Figure 3: The interface given to judges to evaluate whether a given
team's data set mentions and citations were related to a given data
reference.*

As one would expect, while we got coders on the same page, each had
subtly different ideas about what was or was not "related to". To remove
some of this variability from our final data, we then had a sole
experienced researcher who understood what we were trying to do review
all coding and, when he saw coding that obviously did not fit his
understanding, either: revise to fit his understanding of "related to";
or flag as one he was unsure of and note his thoughts.

This experienced researcher also served as a final reviewer of the data
references that were collected, marking any that did not actually refer
to data as needing to be removed from our final analysis.

Finally, the protocol designer reviewed all removed data references,
corrections, and ambiguities flagged for additional review, and made a
final set of corrections.

#### Scoring the Results

To create a "related to" confusion matrix for each team, we started with
a list of all of the data references that our final reviewers indicated
should be included in our analysis (165 total). We created found-or-not
(1 or 0) vectors with a value for every reference set to 1 for the
baseline, and then set based on our coding for each team. For each
publication, we also included a false positive item that was always 0
for the baseline, and that was set to 1 for a given team if they had any
mentions or citations that were not "related to" a data reference from
that publication.

To build a given team's vector, for each data references, we checked to
see if any of the team's mentions or citations had been marked as
"related to" that reference. If one or more of the team's mentions or
citations was marked as "related to", we gave that reference a "1" for
that team. If not, we gave it a "0". Then, for each publication's false
positive item, if the team had 1 or more mentions and/or citations that
were not "related to" any data reference, the team got a "1" for that
entry. If not, they got a "0".

To build out a confusion matrix, we went reference by reference: If the
team found mentions and/or citations related to the reference, that was
counted as a true positive (TP). If a team did not have any mentions or
citations related to a given data reference, it was counted as a false
negative (FN). Then, for the publication, if the team had 1 or more
mentions and/or citations that were not "related to" any data reference,
this was counted as a false positive (FP).

We did not develop a way to capture true negatives since the metrics we
used to evaluate did not require it.

Discussion
==========

Given the time and resources available to put the competition together,
the competition's design was effective, but required some iteration
within each of the phases. We modified and updated both training data
and model submission infrastructure in response to participant feedback,
and the participants were generally quite positive about the experience.

The docker-based model submission process worked well for the
competition, but subsequent use of the models by Digital Science and
Bundesbank has revealed a need to more precisely design how the models
work within their docker container and the APIs they provide so packaged
models implement a more re-usable API. For example, to be readily able
to be used within an existing environment, the model needs to be able to
be invoked from a simple unit of code (a python function, for example),
rather than needing to spin up an instance of a container each time you
want results.

To facilitate re-use, we need much more detailed specification of how
the participants should implement their models. For example:

-   If a submission is implementing multiple tasks, each should be
    broken into its own separate API so it can be used separately (so
    separate services for mention detection, field detection, and data
    detection).

-   We need to better specify how we expect the models to be re-trained,
    in particular elements of the model we expect to be easily changed
    and which we expect would require a full retraining to tune. For
    example, we hoped to be able to easily switch out the data sets of
    interest that are detected specifically without needing to retrain
    on a full corpus referring to those data sets, but we didn't mention
    this, and none of the models worked this way.

In terms of community building, we inspired participation and the
workshop and discussions after the competition lead to collaborations
between pairs of sponsors and participants and collective work on making
a gold standard corpus that could be used to develop better models in
the future (a great step toward higher quality models), but we need to
continue to work to nurture and grow this community.

The data for the competition was a great start, but trying to use it to
detect data mentions and then start to get at whether data was simply
discussed or actually used in analysis revealed how much work remains to
make high quality training data. The base ICPSR data did not include
mention text where we did not create it, and so for the majority of data
sets, the only text available for characterizing a data set was the
title and a paragraph of description, no examples of how the data would
be discussed within a publication. It also did not capture non-ICPSR
data sets, nor did it include data sets mentioned but not used in
analysis. We need to be able to work with imperfect data, but the
complexity of this task makes it a good fit for better training data. We
also found that our definition of a data set was too specific -- ICPSR
is granular down to the year of some of their formal data collections.
Data signatures of interest in the real world might just be clusters of
key terms without a formal title, and our data and models need to
account for this.

Our evaluation approaches were effective given the time we had, but they
also had significant limitations. In phase 1, the ICPSR data was great
for a model that finds named data sets used in analysis, but it was not
as good a fit for evaluating models trying to detect data citations in
general. For example, some high quality models were scored with many
false positives that, on review, were actually correct, but for
non-ICPSR data sets.

In phase 2, our design and evaluation data creation attempted to account
for the limitations of phase 1 - to move from just looking at titled
ICPSR and Bundesbank data sets used for analysis and begin to look at
all the ways data is discussed in academic papers, and how much of that
discussion the combined mentions and citations of each team was aware
of. Its effectiveness depended on how well we designed and carried out
each of these three steps.

We are comfortable with the quality of the resulting data, but it should
be noted that given the time and resources available to us, we had to
make a choice between quality of data and reproducibility. In a perfect
world, content analysis is the discipline of reliably being able to use
a well-designed protocol to create content of comparable quality
regardless of who does the coding. Given this project's relatively tight
timelines and limited resources, in this process we prioritized quality
of data over reproducibility. We created relatively detailed coding
protocols for each step of the process and we designed review and
refinement into our processes, but we did not have time to go through
multiple rounds of training and evaluation to make each of the protocols
reliable and reusable. At the end, we introduced consistency by having
experienced researchers familiar with our goals review all the output
and either correct problems or flag items that should not be used in
analysis. We believe that this created a reasonable level of consistency
and quality in our output, but intend to refine these protocols for use
in the future,

Conclusion
==========

Given the time and resources available, we consider the competition
design to have been effective. The design attracted letters of intent
from 20 teams from 8 countries and 12 teams actually submitted code. The
models were interesting and some of the solutions were novel and
surprisingly effective given their novelty. A nascent community of
practice was also formed. Discussions after the competition led to
collaborations between participants and collective work on making a gold
standard corpus that could be used to develop better models in the
future -- an important step toward higher quality models. The models
also ended up being re-usable as they are, though in a limited scope,
and at least one sponsor has been able to run them and get useful
output.

Additional work is continuing in three directions. The first is
developing better corpora: that is discussed in the Appendix to this
chapter by Alex Wade and Sebastian Kohlmeier. The second is developing a
community of practice: a recent workshop
(<https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextworkshop>) took the next
step to doing so. The third is to further develop the machine learning
and natural language processing tools through broader based competition:
this is discussed in more detail in the concluding chapter in this book.

Appendix - Standardized Metadata, Full Text and Training/Evaluation for Extraction Models
=========================================================================================

Key challenges when working on an NLP task like dataset mention
extraction that requires access to scholarly literature include the
proliferation of metadata sources and sourcing of full text content. For
example, each metadata source has their own approach for disambiguation
(e.g. recognizing that A. Smith and Anna Smith are the same author) or
de-duplication of content (clustering pre-prints and final versions into
a single record). As a result competition organizers and NLP researchers
currently use ad-hoc processes to identify metadata and full text
sources for their specific tasks which results in inconsistencies and a
lack of versioning of input data across competitions and projects.

One way these challenges can be addressed is by using a trustworthy
metadata source like [[Semantic Scholar's open
corpus]{.underline}](http://api.semanticscholar.org/corpus/) developed
by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) or
[[Microsoft's Academic
Graph]{.underline}](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/reference-data-schema)
that make it easy to access standardized metadata from an openly
accessible source. In addition, both Semantic Scholar and the Microsoft
Academic Graph provide topics associated with papers which makes it easy
to narrow down papers by domain. If full text is needed we recommend
tying the metadata to a source of open access full text content like
[[Unpaywall]{.underline}](https://unpaywall.org/data-format) to ensure
that the full text can be freely redistributed and leveraged for model
development.

To gather the data we recommend collecting a sufficiently large set of
full text papers (3,000-5,000 minimum) with their associated metadata
and providing participants with a standardized format of the full text.
More data might be required if data is split across many scientific
domains. For example for a task like dataset extraction, reference
formatting is often inconsistent across domains and dataset mentions can
potentially be found in different sections (e.g. background, methods,
discussion, conclusion or the reference list) throughout the text. Once
a decision has been made on the full text to include, the PDF content
can be easily converted into text in a standardized format using a PDF
to text parser like [[AI2's
ScienceParse]{.underline}](https://github.com/allenai/spv2) (which
handles key tasks like metadata, section heading and references
extraction).

Once the metadata and full text dataset has been created it can be
easily versioned and used again in future competitions. For example, if
updated metadata is needed it's easy to go back to the original metadata
source (for example by using Semantic Scholar's
[[API]{.underline}](http://api.semanticscholar.org/)) to get the latest
metadata.

**[Annotation Protocols to Produce Training & Evaluation
Data]{.underline}**

A common approach to machine learning known as **supervised learning**
uses labelled, or annotated, data to train a model what to look for. If
labelled data is not readily available, human annotators are frequently
used to label, or code, a corpus of representative document samples as
input into such a model. Different labelling tasks may require different
levels of subject domain knowledge or expertise. For example, coding a
document for different parts of speech (POS) will require a different
level of knowledge than coding a document for mentions of upregulation
of genes. The simpler the labelling task, the easier it will be for the
coders to complete the task, and the more likely the annotations will be
consistent across multiple coders. For example, a task to identify a
*mention of a dataset* in a document might be far easier than the task
of identifying only the*mentions of* *datasets that were used in the
analysis phase of research*.

In order to scale the work of labelling, it is usually desirable to
distribute the work amongst many people. Generic crowdsourcing platforms
such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk can be used in some labelling
exercises, as can more tailored services from companies such as TagWorks
and Figure-Eight. Whether the labelling is done by one person or
thousands, the consistency and quality of the annotations needs to be
considered. We would like to build up a sufficiently large collection of
these annotations and we want to ensure that they are of a high quality.
How much data needs to be annotated depends on the task, but in general,
the more labelled data that can be generated the more robust the model
will be.

As mentioned above, we recommend 3000-5000 papers, but this begs the
question of how diverse the subject domains are within this corpus. If
the papers are all within from the finance sector, then a resulting
model might do well in identifying datasets in finance, but less well in
the biomedical domain since the model was not trained on biomedical
papers. Conversely, if our 3000-5000 papers are evenly distributed
across all domains, our model might be more generically applicable, but
might do less well over all since it did not contain enough individual
domain-specific examples.  
\
As a result, we recommend labelling 3000-5000 papers within a domain,
but we plan to do so in a consistent manner across domains so that the
annotations can be aggregated together. In this manner, as papers in new
domains are annotated, our models can be re-trained to expand into new
domains. In order to achieve this, we intend to publish an open
annotation protocol and output format that can be used by the community
to create additional labelled datasets.

Another factor in deciding the quantity is the fact that the annotations
will be used for two discrete purposes. The first is to *train* a
machine learning model. This data will inform the model what dataset
mentions look like, from which it will extract a set of features that
the model will use and attempt to replicate. The second use of the
annotations is to *evaluate* the model. How well a model performs
against some content that it has never seen before. In order to achieve
this, labelled data are typically split randomly into training and
evaluation subsets.

One way to evaluate how well your model performs is to measure the
**recall** and **precision** of the model's output, and in order to do
this we can compare the output to the labelled evaluation subset. In
other words, how well does our model perform against the human
annotations that it was not trained on and has never seen. Recall is the
percentage of right answers the model returned. For example, if the
evaluation dataset contained 1000 mentions of a dataset, and the trained
model returned 800 of them, then the recall value would be .80. But what
if the model returned everything as a dataset, then it would get all
1000, plus a whole bunch of wrong answers. Obviously, the precision of
the model is important too. Precision is the percentage of answers
returned that were right. So, continuing the example above, if the model
returned 888 answers, and 800 of those were right, then the precision of
the model would be \~.90. But again, if the model returned only one
right answer and no wrong ones, the precision would be perfect. So, it
is important to measure both precision and recall. In summary, the model
in this example, got 80% of the right answers, and 90% of the answers it
returned were right. The two measures of recall and precision can be
combined into an F1 score of   ~.847.  
\
If we then make modifications to our model, we can re-run it against the
evaluation dataset and see how our F1 score changes. If the score goes
up, then our new model performed better against this evaluation data. If
we want to compare several different models to see which one performed
best, we can calculate an F1 score for each of them. The one with the
highest F1 score has performed the best. Consequently, the quality of
the annotations are critical for two reasons: first, the accuracy of a
*model* will only be as good as the data upon which it was trained. And
secondly, the accuracy of the *evaluation* (in this case the F1 score)
can be affected by the quality of the data it is evaluated against.

title: Finding datasets in publications: The Allen Institute for AI Approach
---

[Introduction](#sec:intro)
============

The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) is a non-profit
research institute founded by Paul G. Allen with the goal of advancing
artificial intelligence research for the common good. One of the major
undertakings at AI2 is to develop an equitable, unbiased software
platform Semantic Scholar<sup>1</sup> for finding relevant information in the
scientific literature. Semantic Scholar extracts meaningful structures
in a paper (e.g., images, entities, relationships) and links them to
other artifacts when possible (e.g., knowledge bases, GitHub
repositories), hence our interest in the rich context competition (RCC).
In particular, we participated in the RCC in order to explore methods
for extracting and linking datasets used in papers. At the time of this
writing, Semantic Scholar comprehensively covers the computer science
and biomedical literature, and we plan to expand our coverage in 2019 to
other scientific areas, including social sciences.

In the following sections, we describe our approach to the three tasks
of the RCC competition, which are described in more detail in Chapter 5:
1. extracting the datasets used in publications,
2. predicting the field of research of publications
3. extracting the methods used in publications

[Methods](#sec:methods)
=======

[Dataset Extraction and Linking](#sec:datasets_methods)
------------------------------

This task focuses on identifying datasets used in a scientific paper.
Datasets which are merely mentioned but not used in the research paper
are not of interest. This task has two sub-tasks:

1.  Citation prediction: extraction and linking to a provided knowledge
    base of *known datasets*, and

2.  Mention prediction: extraction of both *known and unknown* dataset
    mentions.

### Provided Data ###

The provided knowledge base of known datasets includes approximately 10K
datasets used in social science research. The high textual similarity between
different datasets in the knowledge base informs our approach for linking dataset
mentions to their dataset in the knowledge base. Approximately 10% of the datasets in the
knowledge base were linked one or more times in the provided corpus of
5K papers. To attempt to generalize mention discovery beyond those present in the knowledge base, we train a named entity recognition (NER) model on the noisy annotations provided by the labeled mentions in the knowledge base.

![image](combined_images/datasets.png)
Figure 6.1: A high-level overview of our appraoch to dataset mention detection and linking.

We provide a high-level overview of our approach in Figure
6.1. First, we use an NER
 model to predict dataset mentions. For each mention, we generate a
list of candidate datasets from the knowledge base. We also developed a
rule based extraction system which searches for dataset mentions seen in
the training set, adding the corresponding dataset IDs in the training
set annotations as candidates. We then use a binary classifier to
predict which of these candidates is a correct dataset extraction.

Next, we describe each of the sub-components in more detail.

### Mention and Candidate Generation ###

We first constructed a set of rule based candidate citations by exact
string matching mentions and dataset names from the provided knowledge
base. We found this to have high recall and low precision, both on the provided development fold
and our own development fold that we created. High recall and low precision was the desired outcome for this candidate generation step. However, after our test
submission, it became clear that there were many datasets in the actual
test set that did not have mentions in the provided knowledge base. If the provided development fold had been representative of the test set (rather than the train set) in terms of what datasets were mentioned in it, we could have discovered this issue sooner. In this case, it would have been more representative of the test set if it included more datasets that did not have example mentions in the provided knowledge base. The importance of reliable evaluation and training data is discussed further in Chapter 12.

To address this limitation, we developed an NER model to predict
additional dataset mentions. For NER, we use a bi-LSTM model with a CRF
decoding layer, similar to Peters et al., 2018, and implemented using
the AllenNLP framework<sup>2</sup>. In order to train the NER model, we
automatically generate mention labels by string matching mentions in the
provided annotations against the full text of a paper. This results in
noisy labeled data, because it was not possible to find all correct
mentions this way (e.g., some dataset mentions were not annotated), and
the same string can appear multiple times in the paper, while only some
are correct examples of dataset usage.

We limit the percentage of negative examples (i.e., sentences with no
mentions) used in training to 50%, and use 40 words as the maximum
sentence length. We use 50-dimensional Glove word embeddings
(Pennington et al., 2014), 16-dimensional character embeddings with 64
CNN filters of sizes (2, 3, 4). The CNN character encoder outputs
128-dimensional vectors. We optimize model parameters using ADAM
(Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 0.001. Training the model took approximately 12 hours on a single GPU.

In order to generate linking candidates for the NER mentions, we score
each candidate dataset based on TF-IDF weighted token overlap between the mention
text and the dataset title. For a given mention, many dataset titles can
have a non-zero overlap score, so we take the top 30 scoring candidates
for each mention as the linking candidates for that mention.

### Candidate Linking ###

The linking model takes as input a dataset mention, its context, and one
of the candidate datasets in the knowledge base, and outputs a binary
label. We use a gradient boosted trees classifier using the XGBoost<sup>3</sup>
implementation. The model takes as input the following features:

* prior probability of entity, estimated based on number of occurrences in the training set (float between 0 and 1)
* prior probability of entity given mention, estimated based on number of occurrences in the training set (float between 0 and 1)
* prior probability of mention given entity, estimated based on number of occurrences in the training set (float between 0 and 1)
* whether the same year appears both in the mention context and in the dataset title (binary)
* mention length (int)
* mention sentence length (int)
* whether the mention is an acronym, computed by checking if it is one token that is all upper case (binary)
* estimated section title of the mention, computed by searching backwards from the mention for the nearest section header (binary one-hot)
* count of overlapping words between the mention context and dataset keywords provided in the knowledge base (int)

We note that it is possible to predict zero, one or multiple dataset IDs for the same mention, and each dataset candidate is scored independently.

We performed a randomized hyperparameter search with 100 iterations over the following hyperparameters and ranges and used a learning rate of 10^-1:

* `max_depth` : `range(2, 8)`
* `n_estimators` : `range(1, 50)`
* `colsample_by_tree` : `numpy.linspace(0.1, 0.5, 5)`
* `min_child_weight` : `range(5, 11)`

Each model took a negligible amount of time to train, and the entire hyperparameter search took a few minutes to train on a machine with 8 CPUs.

[Research Area Prediction](#sec:areas_methods)
------------------------

### Data ###

The second task of the competition is to predict research areas of a
paper. The task does not specify the set of research areas of interest,
nor is training data provided for the task. After manual inspection of a
subset of the papers in the provided test set, the SAGE taxonomy of
research, and the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) (Shen et al., 2018), we
decided to use a subset of the fields of study in MAG as labels. In
particular, we included all fields related to social science or papers
from the provided training corpus. However, since the abstract and full
text of papers are not provided in MAG, we only use the paper titles for
training our model. The training data we ended up with included
approximately 75K paper titles along with their fields of study as
specified in two levels of the MAG hierarchy. We held out about 10% of
the titles for development data. The coarse level (L0) has 7 fields
while the more granular one (L1) has 32. Fields associated with less
than 100 papers were excluded.

### Methods ###

For each level, we trained a bi-directional LSTM which reads the paper
title and predicts one of the fields in this level. We additionally
incorporate ELMo embeddings (Peters et al., 2018) to improve performance.
In the final submission, we always predict the most likely field from
the L0 classifier, and only report the most likely field from the L1
classifier if its prediction exceeds a score of 0.4. It takes approximately 1.5
and 3.5 hours for the L0 and L1 classifiers to converge, respectively.

[Research Method Extraction](#sec:methods_methods)
--------------------------

### Data ###

The third task in the competition is to extract the scientific methods
used in the research paper. Since no training data was provided, we
started by inspecting a subset of the provided papers to get a better
understanding of what kind of methods are used in social science and how
they are referred to within papers. This limitation, and the difficulty of working on an undefined task, is discussed in Chapter 2.

### Methods ###

Based on the inspection, we designed regular expressions which capture
common contextual patterns as well as the list of provided SAGE methods.
In order to score candidates, we used a background corpus to estimate
the salience of candidate methods in a paper. Two additional strategies
were attempted but proved unsuccessful: a weakly-supervised model for
named entity recognition, and using open information extraction (openIE)
to further generalize the list of candidate methods.

[Results](#sec:results)
============

[Dataset Extraction and Linking](#sec:datasets_results)
------------------------------

First, we report the results of our NER model in Table
6.1. Since it is easy for the model to memorize
the dataset mentions seen at training time, we created disjoint train,
development, and test sets based on the paper--dataset annotations
provided for the competition. In particular, we sort datasets by the
number of papers they appear in, then process one dataset at a time. For
each dataset, we choose one of the train, development, or test splits at
random and add the dataset to it, along with all papers which mention that dataset. When there is a
conflict, (e.g., a paper *p* has already been added to the
train split when processing an earlier dataset *d<sub>1</sub>*, but it is
also associated with a later dataset *d<sub>2</sub>*), the later dataset
*d<sub>2</sub>* along with all papers associated with it are added to the
same split as *d<sub>1</sub>*. For any further conflicts, we prefer to
put papers in the development split over the train split, and the test
split over the development split.

We also experimented with adding ELMo embeddings (Peters et al., 2018),
but it significantly slowed down training and decoding which would have
disqualified our submission due to the runtime requirements of the
competition. As a result, we decided not to include ELMo embeddings in
our final model. If the requirements for the competition had permitted the use of a GPU at evaluation time, neural network based embeddings like ELMo could be leveraged.

Table 6.3: End-to-end precision, recall, and F1 performance (%) for dataset
prediction on the phase 1 and phase 2 holdout sets. Note that the
phase 1 holdout results are for citation prediction, while the phase 2 holdout results are for mention prediction.


We report the end-to-end performance of our approach (on the development
set provided by the organizers in the first phase) in Table
6.2. This is the performance after using the
linking classifier to predict which candidate mention--dataset pairs are
correct extractions. We note that the development set provided in phase
1 ended up having significantly more overlap with the training data than
the actual test set did. As a result, the numbers reported in Table
6.2 are not indicative of test set performance.
End to end performance from our phase 2 submission can be seen in Table
6.3. This performance is reflective of our
focus on the linking component of this task. Aside from the competition
development set, we also used a random portion of the training set as an
additional development set. The initial model only uses a dataset
frequency feature, which gives a baseline performance of 38.4 F1. Adding
p(d $\mid$ m) and p(m $\mid$ d), which are the probability of entity
given mention and probability of mention given entity improves the
performance ($\Delta = 2.3$ F1). Year matching helps disambiguate
between different datasets in the same series, which was found to be a
major source of errors in earlier models ($\Delta = 2.8$ F1).
Aggregating mentions for a given dataset, adding mention and sentence
length features, adding an is acronym feature, and further
hyper-parameter tuning improve the results ($\Delta = 12.5$ F1). Adding
examples in the development set while training the model results in
further improvements ($\Delta = 2.8$ F1). Finally, adding the NER-based
mentions significantly improves recall at the cost of lower precision,
with a positive net effect on F1 score ($\Delta = 0.7$ F1).

Two clear limitations of our model are its difficulty in generalizing to unseen datasets, and its inability to effectively distinguish between datasets that are used in a publication and datasets that are merely referenced. These limitations are the main causes of the low recall (due to difficulty generalizing to unseen datasets) and low precision (due to difficulty distinguishing between used datasets and referenced datasets). An interesting approach to improving recall is presented in Chapter 7, and could potentially be leveraged in future work.

[Research Area Prediction](#sec:areas_results)
------------------------

To select a model, we performed a 100 trial random search across model
hyper-parameters, evaluated on a held out development set of papers from
the Microsoft Academic Graph. Our final model contained 512 hidden
dimensions, 2 layers and 0.5 dropout prior to classification. The top
performing classifier achieved 84.4% accuracy on our development set on
L0 fields, and 65.2% accuracy on our development set on L1 fields. The main limitation of using MAG for this problem is that our model cannot find new fields of research, and is limited to those provided by MAG. Additionally, our method performs classification based only on the titles of papers, while there are other pieces of information about the paper that would be useful for classifying the field of research. Other resources that could have been used to help with this task are presented in Chapters 7 and 8.

[Research Method Extraction](#sec:methods_results)
--------------------------

We evaluated performance by manually evaluating the output of our
extractor for a subset of 50 papers from the provided test set to
compute precision. Since evaluating recall requires a careful
annotation, we resorted to using yield as an alternative metric. Our
final submission for method extraction has 95% precision and yield of
1.5 methods per paper on the manually inspected subset of papers. Similarly to research area prediction, the main limiation here is the difficulty our model has finding new methods, as it is limited to the SAGE ontology and a few hand-crafted patterns. One potential way to alleviate this issue is to leverage external resources, as presented in Chapter 8.

[Conclusion](#sec:conclusion)
==========

This report summarizes the AI2 submission at the RCC competition. We
identify dataset mentions by combining the predictions of an NER model
and a rule-based system, use TF-IDF to identify candidates for a given
mention, and use a gradient boosted trees classifier to predict a binary
label for each candidate mention--dataset pair. To identify research
fields of a paper, we train two multi-class classifiers, one for each of
the top two levels in the MAG hierarchy for fields of study. Finally, to extract research methods, we
use a rule-based system utilizing a dictionary and common patterns,
followed by a scoring function which takes into account the prominence
of a candidate in foreground and background corpora.

We now provide some possible directions of improvement for each
component of our submission. For dataset extraction, the most promising
avenue of improvement is to improve the NER model, and the most
promising avenue to improve the NER model is to collect less noisy data.
We effectively have distantly supervised training data for the NER
model, and the first thing to try would be directly annotating papers
with dataset mentions to provide a clearer signal for the NER model. As mentioned previously and discussed in Chapters 5 and 8, the dataset mentions provided are not located in the text, and are simply extracted strings. Given these strings, labels in the actual text can be created by searching for the provided string. However, this is a noisy process, as the string may occur multiple times in the document, and all occurrences may or may not be correct dataset mentions. This is especially problematic when the string is a common word (e.g. "time"). Therefore, directly annotating the strings in the full text (i.e. providing character offsets for the strings) would help to reduce the noise in the NER data. For
research area prediction, it would help to include signals beyond just
the paper title for predicting the field of study. The difficulty here
is finding labeled training data that includes richer signals like
abstract text and paper keywords. For method prediction, exploring
the use of open information extraction is a potential avenue
of future research. Additionally, it would be helpful to clarify what
exactly is meant by a method, as it is currently unclear what a
successful method extraction looks like.
The main lesson learned is that, when presented with noisy, distantly supervised, real-world data, to produce a production-quality system, it becomes very important to (1) have a high-confidence evaluation dataset, and (2) look for other data sources that are similar enough to the task at hand to be useful. Taking steps towards both of these objectives are promising avenues of future work.

As discussed in Chapter 1 and throughout, the dataset extraction discussed in this report is intended to be part of a broader effort to create infrastructure and tools that will aid in the discovery and usage of datasets in social science research. This is critical to enable reproduciblity, collaboration, and effective use of data. We look forward to seeing what comes out of this project as a whole, and how AI techniques can be leveraged to have positive impact in the social sciences.

title: 'Finding datasets in publications: The KAIST approach. Text Mining Using Question Answering'
---

Non-technical Overview
=============
The KAIST’s approach for retrieving datasets is to generate questions about datasets like *what is the dataset used in this publication?* and use a machine-learning system that can read a publication and a question, and give the answer to it. This machine-learning system retrieves a list of candidate answers among which one of them should be the name of the dataset. To remove those wrong candidate answers, they proposed to filter them out by their entity types. For example, if the entity type of a candidate answer is *organization*, it is likely to be a dataset name because datasets are created by organizations.

For research field retrieval, they proposed to compare publications with Wikipedia articles to discover the research fields. First, they crawled Wikipedia articles that correspond to the list of research fields. Then, they retrieved the research fields of the publications by measuring the similarity between the papers and the crawled Wikipedia documents. For example, they crawled the Wikipedia article *economic history* which corresponds to the research field *economic history*. If the similarity between a publication and the article *economic history* is high enough, it is determined that the publication belongs to the research field *economic history*. They proposed to use TF-IDF as similarity measure, which is based on term frequency and document frequency, but others could be applied too.

For the research methods retrieval, they modeled the task as a named-entity recognition problem. They considered research methods as named entities, real-world objects that can be denoted with a proper name, and trained a machine learning model to identify and retrieve them.

Literature Review
=============

Although *Information Retrieval* is a well-established research field, only a few attempts have focused on the task of dataset extraction form publications. [@ghavimi2016identifying] tackled this problem using heuristics and dictionaries but encountered several problems. Firstly, they gave too much weight to acronyms. For example, *NYPD (New York Police Department)* is detected as a dataset name.
Secondly, they gave too much weight to the year of publication of the datasets because they assumed that dataset names are usually followed by the year of publication. However, this may only apply to Social Sciences publications. For example, Computer Science datasets do not appear followed by the publication year so this heuristic cannot detect all possible types of dataset mentions.

What did you do
=============

In this section, a detailed explanation of the used models for dataset names, research field, and research methods retrieval is provided.

Datasets Retrieval
------------------

The followed approach to retrieve dataset names is based on Machine Reading Question Answering (MRQA). First, given a publication, a list of candidate paragraphs in which the dataset is mentioned is selected. Then, using a query generation module, a specific query for each paragraph is created. After that, each pair of paragraph-query is input into the MRQA model. This model creates a list of candidate answers that is further processed using a feed-forward neural network. This network takes as input pairs of candidate answers and their entity types. The types of the answer candidates are obtained using an entity typing module. The output of this feed-forward neural network is the final list of dataset names found in the publication. Figure 7.1 shows an overview of the pipelined system. In the following subsections, the MRQA, query generation, and entity typing models are explained in detail.

![image](combined_images/OverallModel.png)

*Figure 7.1: Overall architecture for dataset retrieval*

### Document QA

MRQA models are neural networks that find answers for given queries according to a text. These answers must appear explicitly in the text. Since the dataset retrieval task is about finding explicit dataset mentions from publications, MRQA models are suitable for this task.

The MRQA model used in this work is Document QA [@clark2017simple]. It uses Bi-GRU, bi-attention, and self-attention mechanism. In addition, Document QA performs a paragraph selection that pre-filters and selects the *k* most relevant paragraphs using TF-IDF similarity between the query and paragraphs of the text. The model was trained on SQuAD v1.1, a common dataset to train MRQA models [@rajpurkar2016squad]. For details about the implementation and computing resources to train it, they refer to the original publication.

The KAIST team had the hypothesis that MRQA models do not need the full publication to find datasets. Rather, the MRQA models only need to process the paragraph where the answer appears. Among the literature of MRQA, the model used in this work stands out because of its paragraph selection stage. Using this model, it is possible to select a list of candidate paragraphs where the answer may appear, and then use the MRQA model to process them and retrieve the datasets.


### Query Generation Module

Queries that are suitable for finding datasets are required to utilize an MRQA model for the dataset retrieval task. However, defining a general query for retrieving datasets is not trivial, since the dataset mentions appear in various forms like surveys, datasets, or studies. Therefore, they devised a query generation module to generate multiple specific queries instead of a single general query.

To create a list of important query terms that the queries should include, they used a query generation model proposed by [@yuan2017machine] that creates a query given a text and an answer. All the queries generated by this model are too specific and cannot be used for other publications or other dataset names. However, they can be utilized to create a list of query terms to generate more specific queries for other publications. To create this list, they extracted query terms that are frequent in the list of queries and at the same time are not frequent in sentences that do not include a mention to a dataset. Because of this, these query terms have the discriminative power to retrieve dataset mentions since 1) queries are generated to extract mentions and 2) the query terms do not appear in the sentences without dataset mentions.
This list is used two times in their pipelined system. First, concatenating the first *k* query terms a general query is built. This query is employed by the paragraph selection stage of Document QA, as shown in Figure 7.1. Then, the query generation module generates specific queries for each paragraph concatenating the query terms that appear in the paragraph and on the list.

### Entity Typing Model

Ultra-Fine Entity Typing [@Choi:2018:ACL] can predict a set of free-from phrases like *criminal* or *skyscraper* given a sentence with an entity mention. For example, in the sentence: *Bob robbed John and he was arrested shortly afterward*, Bob is of type *criminal*. In the task of the present book, candidate answers proposed by the MRQA model and the sentence in which they appear are input into Ultra-Fine Entity Typing. This system can predict 10k different entity types among which *dataset* is included. However, after a few experiments, they observed that most of the entity types obtained from the dataset names are not *dataset* but *organization*, *agency*, and similar types. This is due to the fact that datasets are usually created by organizations and thus, they include the name of the organization in the name of the dataset. Since these entity types are consistent, it is possible to use them as a feature for their candidate answer classifier. In this work, the KAIST team used the pre-trained model that was released with the original publication. For details about the implementation and computing resources to train it, they refer to the original publication.

### Candidate Answer Classifier

Using the score given by the MRQA model for each candidate answer and the entity types given by the Entity Typing model for each candidate answer, a neural network classifier that filters the wrong candidate answers provided by the MRQA model is used. The intuition of this classifier is that a candidate answer with a high score given by the MRQA model and whose entity type is *organization* or something similar is highly likely to be a correct dataset name. Due to this pattern, they were able to create a neural network classifier to filter out candidate answers.

The classifier has the following architecture:

1.  Input size: 10332 (10331 labels from Ultra-Fine Entity Typing and one from the Document QA score)

2.  1 hidden layer with 50 neurons

3.  Output size: 2

The training set consists of 25172 examples and the test set of 6293 examples obtained from the training set provided by the competition. To train the network, Adam optimizer was used with cross entropy as the loss function.

Research Fields Retrieval
-------------------------

Their approach to obtain research fields is based on comparing the publications with Wikipedia articles using TF-IDF similarity. First, using the list of research fields provided by the competition, a set of Wikipedia articles about different research fields was obtained using the Python library MediaWiki. The list provided by the competition has three levels of hierarchy as shown in the example (Figure 7.2). The leaf nodes of that hierarchy were searched in Wikipedia to retrieve specific research fields instead of general ones. For example, they were aiming to retrieve *Neurosurgery* instead of *Medicine*. Then, using Scikit-learn [@scikit-learn], a TF-IDF matrix of all the publications and Wikipedia articles of research fields were computed. The research field and all its superior nodes in the hierarchy associated with the Wikipedia article most similar to the publication were returned along with the similarity in the range \[0,1\]. The overall architecture can be seen in Figure 7.3.

![Overall architecture for research fields retrieval[]{label="fig:researchfields"}](combined_images/researchfields2.png)*Figure 7.3:  Overall architecture for research fields retrieval*

Research Methods Retrieval
--------------------------

For the research methods retrieval task, they modeled it as a named-entity recognition (NER) problem. Research methods are considered to be named entities and because of this, they can be tagged as research method label (RS) instead of common NER labels such as *location*, and *people*. Figure 7.4 shows the main architecture of the model proposed by [@lample2016neural] and used in this task.

![BiLSTM-CRF architecture](combined_images/bi-lstm.png)*Figure 7.4: Paragraph selection for DocQA in research method retrieval*

The representation of a word using the model is obtained considering its context. The KAIST team had the assumption that research methods have dependencies and constraints with words that appear in their surrounding context. Therefore, the conditional random field [@lafferty2001conditional] layer in this model is suitable for detecting research methods by jointly tagging the whole sentence, instead of independently tagging each word.

For this task, the research method phrases that appeared in the training set were marked using as reference the list of research methods provided by the competition. Then, the training set was represented in CoNLL 2003 format [@tjong2003introduction], using IOB tag (Inside, Outside, Beginning) to train the model. Every token was labeled as B-RS if the token is the beginning of a research method, I-RS if it is inside a research method but not the first token, or O otherwise. Training the model took approximately one day using a CPU AMD Ryzen 7 2700, a GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, and 8GB RAM.

What worked and what didn’t
===========================
The KAIST team tried different ideas to extract dataset names. First, they tried to extract the dataset names using hand-crafted queries in the MRQA model. However, they noticed that these manually generated queries do not have sufficient discriminative power. Therefore, they tried to generate a general query with enough discriminative power to retrieve datasets' names. To this end, they converted the sentences containing the dataset into queries and then clustered the converted queries to get general queries. However, they found that each of the resulting clusters did not reflect the semantics of the desired general queries. Hence, they had to create specific queries for each publication as explained in the previous section. These specific queries helped to increase the recall but at the same time affected negatively to the precision. The use of entity typing worked well to remove the wrong candidate answers proposed by the MRQA model. Thanks to this entity-type filtering, they were able to improve the recall using the query generation module without sacrificing the precision.

They also tried to use the section names as a feature for the paragraph selection module of Document QA. However, the use of section names degraded the overall performance. In their analysis, they stated that the heuristics that they used to extract them generated noise that affected the performance. For example, *total*, *variable*, and *funding* were detected as section names but clearly, they are not.

Finally, their idea to compare publications with Wikipedia articles to retrieve research fields yielded successful results. But on the other hand, their first idea to retrieve research methods was not successful. It was based on identifying the context words of the research methods by using the frequency of those words. The reason for the bad performance was due to the lack of discriminative power of the most common words that co-occur with the research methods. Therefore, they tried to model it as a NER problem, where they consider each research method that appeared in a publication as a named-entity. By modeling the problem in this way, they could use existing NER models to extract research methods from publications. However, this approach did not achieve satisfactory results either.


Summary of your results and caveats
===================================

Due to the difficulty of performing a quantitative analysis on a not extensively labeled dataset, a qualitative analysis was made. Several random publications were chosen and manually labeled to check the quality of the model and discover the strong and weak points.

Datasets Retrieval
------------------

To analyze the effects of the query generation module and entity typing module, they performed analyses on 100 publications from the dev set of the first phase using three different settings:

1.  Document QA only

2.  Document QA + Query Generation Module

3.  Document QA + Query Generation Module + Entity Typing Module

### Document QA only

Figure 7.5 shows the results from three publications from the list of analyzed publications using *Document QA only*. Compared to the other settings, *Document QA only* setting retrieves high-quality answers (dataset mentions). However, the number of retrieved answers is notably small. For example, the result from *153.txt* publication is empty as shown in Figure 7.5. In fact, using this setting the model can only retrieve 260 answers (predictions) from the list of analyzed publications.

![Results from Document QA only[]{label="fig:docqaonly"}](combined_images/OnlyDocQA.png)*Figure 7.5: Results from Document QA only. Right answers from the model in blue.*

These results were expected due to the difficulty of defining general queries as explained in section [*Question Generation Module*](#query-generation-module). Without a query generation module, it is hard to make a representative enough query to retrieve various forms and types of the dataset mentions.

### Document QA + Query Generation Module

Figure 7.6 shows the results from three publications from the list of analyzed datasets using Document QA and the Query Generation Module. Because of the addition of the Query Generation Module, a larger number of answers were retrieved. For example, the result from *153.txt* publication contains several answers including the right one, *Micro Database Direct Investment*. Therefore, this and the retrieval of more than 2,000 answers from the list of analyzed datasets proves that the Query Generation Module improves recall of the entire dataset retrieval model. On the other hand, compared to the *Document QA only* setting, there is a considerable amount of wrong candidate answers. For instance, in Figure 7.6, *empirical*, *Table 1*, and *Section 4* are not dataset mentions.

![Results from Document QA + Query Generation Module[]{label="fig:docqaquery"}](combined_images/DocQA_QG.png)*Figure 7.6: Results from Document QA + query generation module. Right answers from the model in blue.*

They believe that the reason for this noise is that some query terms may cause the retrieval of wrong answers. For example, the query term *study* can help to retrieve dataset mentions such as *ANES 1952 Time Series Study*. However, this term can also retrieve wrong answers such as *empirical study*. These types of query terms are still needed to retrieve various forms and types of dataset mentions but clearly generate noise.

### Document QA + Query Generation Module + Entity Typing Module

Figure 7.7 shows the results of the analyzed publications using Document QA, the Query Generation Module, and the Entity Typing Module. Although the Entity Typing Module might not remove all the wrong answers caused by the Query Generation Module such as *4 2.1 Micro Data*, most of them are successfully removed and thus, the overall precision is improved. Using this setting the model retrieves 526 answers (predictions) from 100 publications from the dev set of the first phase of the competition.

![Results from Document QA + Query Generation Module + Entity Typing Module[]{label="fig:docqaqueryentity"}](combined_images/FullModel.png)*Figure 7.7: Results from Document QA + query generation module + entity typing module. Right answers from the model in blue.*

Research Fields Retrieval
-------------------------

They randomly selected 20 publications from the training set of the first phase. They can test their model using the training set because the model does not require any training phase. The model was able to predict research fields correctly for 11 of those publications. The strongest point is that the model is able to predict research fields that are significantly specific such as *Home health nursing management*. Among the weak points of the model, it has problems when two research fields are similar or share subtopics. Moreover, sometimes it fails due to the fact that it tries to retrieve excessively specific fields while more general ones would be suitable.

Research Methods Retrieval
--------------------------

20 random publications were selected and labeled from the training set of the second phase and the results are not satisfactory. The model is able to find proper research methods for 12 publications out of 20. For example, the model successfully detects the research method of the publication with id 15359, *Factor analysis*. However, the results contain a significant amount of noise. For example, the model retrieves for the document with id 10751 several wrong answers like *Reviews describe*, *Composite materials*, and *Detailed databases*.

Lessons learned and what would you do differently
=================================================
After the completion of this project, the KAIST team realized that some steps could have been in a different way and would have led to better results. For example, they focused a lot on the model creation, but they could have spent more time on the analysis of the dataset to extract all its potential and search for additional datasets to alleviate the noise of the provided dataset.

In addition, since Document QA is good for prototyping, it was a good idea to use it at the beginning to check that their hypothesis of modeling dataset retrieval as a Question Answering task was right. However, at some point during the project, they should have changed it to another model with state-of-the-art performance. Also, they use symbolic queries for the MRQA model. But since they are generating specific queries for each publication, it should be possible to define and generate queries in the form of embeddings. This could help to improve even more the recall boost provided by the Query Generation Module and at the same time avoid the generation of noise. Furthermore, for research fields, other ranking methods should have been tried like BM25, a ranking function used by search engines whose performance is better than TF-IDF. Finally, for research methods, they should have analyzed more the dataset to use more suitable techniques such as unsupervised NER instead of supervised NER.

Conclusion
===============
The KAIST team proposed to model the dataset retrieval task as a Question Answering task. This is a unique approach in this competition and led to successful results as shown in the analysis. This approach is flexible because it allows the retrieval of new datasets that are not in the training set. In addition, the model does not require to be trained on a dataset discovery task. They achieved good results even though they used a pre-trained model on SQuAD, a dataset for Question Answering using Wikipedia pages.
Their approach to retrieve research fields is simple, fast to compute, and powerful. It can retrieve specific research fields with high precision. On the other hand, the proposed approach to retrieve research methods did not achieve as good results as the other task. The main problem was that they did not tackle the noise problem in the dataset.

What comes next
===============

This work is the very first step of the Coleridge Initiative to build an "Amazon.com" for data users and data producers. The next step is to construct a system that recommends datasets to researchers. The KAIST team has the hypothesis that datasets depend on research fields and vice versa. For example, in the research field *Question Answering*, a subfield of *Natural Language Processing* and *Computer Science*, the most commonly used dataset is SQuAD [@rajpurkar2016squad]. Therefore, according to their hypothesis, two publications using SQuAD are presumably to be in the same field, *Question Answering*. Based on this hypothesis, it would be possible to build hierarchical clusters of publications with the same research field. In this way, a cluster will have publications with the same research field and similar datasets. As an example, the QA cluster will have papers about QA and those papers will use similar datasets like SQuAD and TriviaQA [@joshi2017triviaqa]. With these clusters, the system will be able to recommend datasets to data users. For example, if a publication is in the *Question Answering* field, the proposed system would be able to recommend the authors SQuAD and TriviaQA. Moreover, it would be able to recommend to data producers fields with a lack of datasets.

In addition,  there is room for improvement in the models they proposed. For example, since they used a pre-trained model in Document QA, they think they did not exploit the whole potential of this system, so they would like to train the model using a big enough training set of publications.

# Knowledge Extraction from scholarly publications - The GESIS contribution to the Rich Context Competition

## 1. Introduction

GESIS - the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences (GESIS)\[1\] is
the largest European research and infrastructure provider for the social
sciences and offers research data, services and infrastructures
supporting all stages of the scientific process. The GESIS department
*Knowledge Technologies for the Social Sciences (WTS)*\[2\] is
responsible for developing all digital services and research data
infrastructures at GESIS and aims at providing integrated access to
social sciences data and services. Next to traditional social sciences
research data, such as surveys and census data, an emerging focus is to
build data infrastructures able to exploit novel forms of social
sciences research data, such as large Web crawls and archives.

Research at WTS\[3\] addresses areas such as Information Retrieval (IR),
Information Extraction (IE) & Natural Language
Processing (NLP), semantic technologies and human computer interaction
and aims at ensuring access and use of social sciences research data
along the FAIR principles, for instance, through interlinking of
research data, established vocabularies and knowledge graphs and by
facilitating semantic search across distinct platforms and datasets. Due
to the increasing importance of Web- and W3C standards as well as
Web-based research data platforms, in addition to traditional research
data portals, findability and interoperability of research data across
the Web constitutes one current challenge. In the context of Web-scale
reuse of social sciences resources, the extraction of structured data
about scholarly entities such as datasets and methods from unstructured
and semi-structured text, as found in scientific publications or
resource metadata, is crucial in order to be able to uniquely identify
social sciences resources and to understand their inherent relations.

Prior works at WTS/GESIS addressing such challenges apply NLP and
machine learning techniques to, for instance, extract and disambiguate
mentions of datasets\[4\] (Boland et al., 2012; Ghavimi et al., 2016)),
authors (Backes, 2018a, 2018b) or software tools (Boland and Krüger,
2019) from scientific publications or to extract and fuse scholarly data
from large-scale Web crawls (Sahoo et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2019).
Resulting pipelines and data are used to empower scholarly search
engines such as the *GESIS-wide search*\[5\] (Hienert et al., 2019)
which provides federated search for scholarly resources (datasets,
publications etc.) across a range of GESIS information systems or the
*GESIS DataSearch* platform\[6\] (Krämer et al., 2018), which enables
search across a vast number of social sciences research datasets mined
from the Web.

Given the strong overlap of our research and development profile with
the recent initiatives of the Coleridge Initiative to evolve this
research field through the Rich Context Competition (RCC)\[7\], we are
enthusiastic about having participated in the RCC2018 and are looking
forward to continue this collaboration towards providing sound
frameworks and tools which automate the process of interlinking and
retrieving scientific resources.

The central tasks in the RCC are the extraction and disambiguation of
mentions of datasets and research methods as well as the classification
of scholarly articles into a discrete set of research fields. After the
first phase, each team received feedback from the organizers of the RCC
consisting of a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Whereas
quantitative results of our inital contribution throughout phase one
have shown significant room for improvement, the qualitative
assessement, conducted by four judges on a sample of ten documents,
underlined the potential of our approach.

Since we have been shortlisted for the second phase of the RCC, this
chapter describes our approaches, techniques, and additional data used
to address all three tasks. As described in the following subsections,
we decided to follow a module-based approach where each module or the
entire pipeline can be reused. The remaining chapter is organised as
follows. The following Section 2 provides an overview
of our approach, used background data and preprocessing steps, whereas
Sections 3, 4, and 5 describe our approaches in more
detail, including results towards each of the tasks. Finally, we discuss
our results in Section 6 and provide an overview of
future work in Section 7.

## 2. Approach, data and pre-processing

This section describes the external data sources we used as well as our
pre-processing steps.

### 2.1 Approach overview and initial evaluation feedback

The central tasks in the RCC are the extraction of dataset mentions from
text. Even so, we considered the discovery of research methods and
research fields important. To this end, we decided to follow a
module-based approach. Users could choose to use each specific module
solely or as parts of a data processing pipeline.
Figure 8.2 shows an overview of
modules developed and their dependencies. Here, the upper three modules
(which are in gray) describe the pre-processing steps (cf.
Section 2.3). The lower four modules (blue) are used
to generate the output in a predefined format as specified by the
competition.

![image](combined_images/information-flow.png)
Figure 8.1: An overview of the individual software modules described in this
document and their dependencies. Gray: Our pre-processing pipeline. Blue: three main tasks of the RCC.

The pre-processing step consists of extracting metadata and raw text
from PDF documents. The output of this step is then used by the software
modules responsible for tackling the individual sub-tasks. These
sub-tasks are to discover research datasets (cf. Section 3),
methods (cf. Section 4) and fields (cf. Section 5). First, a Named Entity
Recognition module is used to find dataset mentions. This module used a
supervised approach trained on a weakly labled corpus. In the next step,
we combine all recognized mentions for each publication and compare
these mentions to the metadata from the list of datasets given by the
competition. For this linking step the mentions and year information
located in the same sentence are used. The corresponding sentence and
extracted information are saved for debugging and potential usage in
future pipeline components. The task of identifying research methods is
solved unsing a Named Entity Recognition and Linking module with
incorporated word embeddings and lexical resources. For identifying
research fields, we trained a classifier on openly available abstracts
and metadata from the domain of social sciences crawled from the Social
Science Open Access Repository\[8\] (SSOAR). We tried different
classifiers and selected the best performing one, a classifier based on
fasttext\[9\], i.e. a neural net based approach with a high
performance(Joulin et al., 2017).

After the first phase, each team received feedback from the organizers
of the RCC. The feedback is two folds, a quantitative and qualitative
evaluation. Unfortunately, the quantitative assessment showed our
algorithm for dataset mention retrieval did not perform well regarding
precision and recall metrics. In contrast to this, our approach has been
found convincing regarding the quality of results. The qualitative
feedback is based on a random sample of ten documents given to four
judges. The judges were asked to manually extract dataset mentions.
After this the overlap between their dataset extractions and the output
of our algorithm was calculated. Other factors that judges took into
consideration are specificity, uniqueness, and multiple occurrences of
dataset mentions. As for the extraction of research methods and fields,
no ground truth has been provided; these tasks were evaluated against
the judges’ expert knowledge. Similarly to the extraction of dataset
mentions, specificity and uniqueness have been considered for these two
tasks. The feedback our team received was overall positive.

### 2.2 External data sources

For developing our algorithms, we utilized two external data sources.
For the discovery of research methods and fields, we resort to data from
the Social Science Open Access Repository\[10\] (SSOAR). GESIS – Leibniz
Institute for the Social Sciences maintains SSOAR by collecting and
archiving literature of relevance to the social sciences.

In SSOAR, full texts are indexed using controlled social science
vocabulary (Thesaurus\[11\], Classification\[12\]) and are assigned rich
metadata. SSOAR offers documents in various languages. The corpus of
English language publications that can be used for purposes of the
competition consists of a total of 13,175 documents. All SSOAR documents
can be accessed through the OAI-PMH\[13\] interface.

Another external source we have used to discover research methods is the
ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (Bird et al., 2008). ACL ARC is a corpus
of scholarly publications about computational linguistics. The corpus
consists of a total of 22,878 articles.

### 2.3 Pre-processing

Although the organizers of the RCC offered plain texts for the
publication, we decided to build our own pre-processing pipeline. The
extraction of text from PDF files is still an error prone process. To
handle de-hyphenation and paragraph segmentation during extraction time
and benefit from automatic metadata extraction (i.e. title, author,
abstracts and references) we decided to use a third party extraction
tool. The Cermine Extraction Tool\[14\](Tkaczyk et al., 2015) transforms
the files into XML documents using the Journal Article Tag
Suite\[15\](Jats). For the competition we identified two interesting
elements of the Jats XML format, i.e., \(<\)front\(>\) and
\(<\)body\(>\). The \(<\)front\(>\) element contains the metadata of the
publication, whereas the \(<\)body\(>\) contains the main textual and
graphic content of the publication. As a last step of the
pre-processing, we removed all linebreaks from the publication. The
output of this step is a list of metadata fields and values, as shown in
Table 8.1 for each publication paragraph.

|                   | Example Text Field Data         |

## 3. Dataset extraction

### 3.1 Task description

In the scientific literature, datasets are cited to reference, for
example, the data on which an analysis is performed or on which a
particular result or claim is based. In this competition, we focus on
(i) extracting and (ii) disambiguating dataset mentions from social
science publications to a list of given dataset references. Identifying
dataset mentions in literature is a challenging problem due to the huge
number of styles of citing datasets. Although there are proposed
standards for dataset citation in full-texts, researchers still ignore
or neglect such standards (see, e.g., (Altman and King, 2007)).
Furthermore, in many research publications, a correct citation of
datasets is often missing (Boland et al., 2012). The following two
sentences exemplify the problem of the usage of an abbreviation to make
a reference to an existing dataset. The first example illustrates the
use of abbreviations that are known mainly in the author’s research
domain. The latter illustrates the ambiguity of abbreviations. In this
case, *WHO* identifies a dataset published by the World Health
Organization and does not refer to the institution itself.
**Example 1**: *P-values are reported for the one-tail paired t-test on
*Allbus* (dataset mention) and *ISSP* (dataset mention).*
**Example 2**: *We used *WHO data from 2001* (dataset mention) to
estimate the spreading degree of AIDS in Uganda.*
We treat the problem of detecting dataset mentions in full-text as a
Named Entity Recognition (NER) task.

#### Formal problem definition

Let \(D\) denote a set of existing datasets \(d\) and the knowledge base
\(K\) as a set of known dataset references \(k\). Furthermore, each
element of \(K\) is referencing an existing dataset \(d\). The Named
Entity Recognition and Linking task is defined as (i) the identification
of dataset mentions \(m\) in a sentence, where \(m\) references a
dataset \(d\) and (ii) linking them, when possible, to one element in
\(K\) (i.e., the reference dataset list given by the RCC).

### 3.2 Challenges

We focus on the extraction of dataset mentions in the body of the
full-text of scientific publications. There are three types of dataset
mentions: (i) The full name of a dataset (”National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey“), (ii) an abbreviation (”NHaNES“) or (iii) a vague
reference, e.g., ”the monthly statistic“. With all these these types,
the NER task faces special challenges. In the first case, the used
dataset name can vary in different publications. For instance one
publication cites the dataset with ”National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey“ the other could use the words ”Health and Nutrition
Survey“. In the case where abbreviations are used, a disambiguation
problem occurs, e.g., in ”WHO data“. WHO may describe the World Health
Organization or the White House Office. In the case, that an
abbreviation is used after the dataset name has been written in full,
the mapping between these different spellings in one text is referred to
as Coreference Resolution. The biggest challenge is again the lack of
annotated training data. In the following we describe how we have dealt
with this lack of ground truth data.

### 3.3 Phase one approach

Missing ground truth data is the main problem to handle during this
competition. To this end, supervised learning methods for dataset
mentions extraction from texts are not applicable without the
identification of external training data or the creation of useful
labeled training data from information given by the competition. Because
of the lack of existing training data for the task of dataset mention
extraction we resort to the provided list of dataset mentions and
publication pairs and re-annotate the particular sentences in the
publication text. A list of dataset identifying words is provided for
some of the known links between publications and datasets by the
competition. These words represent the evidence of the linkage between
publication and datasets and are extracted from the publication text. In
the course of re-annotation, we search for each of the identifying words
in the corresponding publication texts. For each match, we annotate the
occurence in our raw text and use these annotations as ground truth. As
described in the pre-processing section, our units for processing the
publication text are paragraphs. The re-annotated corpus consists of a
list of paragraphs for each publication with stand-off annotations
identifying the mentions of datasets (i.e. position of the start and end
characters and the entity type for each mention: *dataset*). This
re-annotation is then used to train Spacy’s neural network-based NER
model\[16\]. We created a holdout set of 1,000 publications and a
training set of size 4,000. Afterwards, we train our model with the
paragraphs as a sampling unit. In the training set, 0.45 percent of the
paragraphs contained mentions. For each positive training example, we
have added one negative sample that contains no known dataset mentions
and is randomly selected. We used a batch size of 25 and a dropout rate
of 0.4. The model was trained for 300 iterations.

#### Evaluation

We evaluated our model with respect to four metrics: precision and
recall, each for strict and for partial match. While the strict match
metrics are standard evaluation metrics, the partial match metrics are
their relaxed variants in which the degree to which dataset mentions
have to match can vary. Consider the following partial match example:
"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey" is the extracted
dataset mention, while "National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES)" is the true dataset mention. In contrast to the strict version
of the metrics, this overlapping match is considered a match for the
partial version. The scores describe whether a model is able to find the
correct positions of dataset mentions in the texts, even if the start
and end positions of the characters are not the same, but the ranges
overlap.

| Metric                    | Value |
| :------------------------ | :---: |
| Precision (partial match) | 0.93  |
| Recall (strict match)     | 0.95  |
| Precision (strict match)  | 0.80  |
| Recall (strict match)     | 0.81  |

Table 8.2 shows the results of the dataset mention extraction on the holdout set. The
model can achieve high strict precision and recall values. As expected,
the results are even better for the partial version of the metrics. It
means that even if we couldn’t match the dataset mention in a text
exactly, we can find the right context with very high precision.

### 3.4 Phase two approach

In the second phase of the competition, additional 5,000 publications
were provided by RCC. We extended our approach to consider the list with
dataset names supplied by the organizers and re-annotated the complete
corpus of 15,000 publications in the same manner as in phase one to
obtain training data. This time we split the data in 80% for training
and 20% for test.

#### Evaluation

We resort to the same evaluation metrics as in phase one. However, we
calculate precision and recall on the full-text of the publication and
not on the paragraphs as in the first phase.
Table 8.3 shows the results achieved by our model. We observe lower precision and
recall values. Compared to phase one, there is also a smaller difference
between the precision and recall values for the strict and partial
version of the metrics.

| Metric                    | Value |
| :------------------------ | :---: |
| Precision (partial match) | 0.51  |
| Recall (partial match)    | 0.90  |
| Precision (strict match)  | 0.49  |
| Recall (strict match)     | 0.87  |

## 4. Research method extraction

### 4.1 Task description

Inspired by a recent work of Nasar et al. (Nasar et al., 2018), we
define a list of basic entity types that give key-insights into
scholarly publications. We adapted the list of semantic entity types to
the domain of the social sciences with a focus on *research methods*,
but also including related entity types such as *theory, todel,
measurement, tool, performance*. We suspect that the division into
semantic types might be helpful to find *research methods*. The reason
is that the related semantic entities types might provide clues or might
be directly related to the research method itself.

For example, in order to achieve a certain research goal, an experiment
is used in which a certain combination of *methods* is applied to a
*dataset*. The methods can be specified as concepts or indirectly
through the use of certain *software*. The result is then quantified
with a *performance* using a specific measure.

**Example**: *P-values* (measurement) are reported for the *one-tail
paired t-test* (method) on *Allbus* (dataset) and *ISSP* (dataset).
We selected the entity types *research method*, *research theory*,
*research tool* and *research measurement* as the target research method
related entity types (see Table 8.4). This decision is based
on an ecxamination of the SAGE ontology given by the RCC as a sample of
how research method terms might look like.

|                            |                   |                                                  |
| :------------------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity type**            | **Corresponding** | **Examples**                                     |
|                            | **SAGE type**     |                                                  |
| Research Method            | SAGE-METHOD       | Bootstrapping, Active Interviews                 |
| Research Measurement       | SAGE-MEASURE      | Latent Variables, Phi coefficient, Z-score       |
| Research Theory            | SAGE-THEORY       | Frankfurt school, Feminism, Actor network theory |

Table 8.4: Entity types of relevance for the research method extraction task.

#### Formal problem definition

The task of Named Entity Recognition and Linking is to (i) identify the
mentions \(m\) of research-related entities in a sentence and (ii) link
them, if possible, to a reference knowledge base \(K\) (i.e. the SAGE
Thesaurus\[17\]) or (iii) assign a type to each entity, e.g. a *research
method*, selected from a set of predefined types.

### 4.2 Challenges

There are some major challenges that any named entity recognition,
classification and linking system needs to handle. First, regarding NER,
identifying the entities boundary is important, thus detecting the exact
sequence span. Second, ambiguity errors might arise in classification.
For instance,‘range’ might be a domain-specific term from the knowledge
base or belong to the general domain vocabulary. This is a challenging
task for which context information is required. In the literature, this
relates to the problem of **domain adaptation** which includes
fine-tuning to specific named entity classes\[18\]. With respect to
entity linking, another challenge is detecting name variations, since
entities can be referred to in many different ways. Semantically similar
words, synonyms or related words, which might be lexically or
syntactically different, are often not listed in the knowledge base
(e.g., the lack of certain terms like ‘questioning’ but not
‘questionnaire’). This problem of automatically detecting these
relationships is generally known as **linking problem**. Note that part
of this problem also results from PDF-to-text conversion which is
error-prone. Dealing with incomplete knowledge bases, i.e. **handling of
out of vocabulary (OOV) items**, is also a major issue, since knowledge
bases are often not exhaustive enough and do not cover specific terms or
novel concepts from recent research. Last but not least, the combination
of different semantic types gives a more coherent picture of a research
article. We hypothesize that such information would be helpful and
results in an insightful co-occurrence statistics, and provides
additional detail directly related to entity resolution, and finally
helps to assess the **relevance of terms** by means of a score.

### 4.3 Our approach

Our research method extraction tool builds on Stanford’s CoreNLP and
Named Entity Recognition System\[19\]. The information extraction
process follows the workflow depicted in
figure 8.2, using separate modules for
pre-processing, classification, linking and term filtering.

![image](combined_images/research-methods-pipeline.png)
Figure 8.2: Overview of the entity extraction pipeline.

We envision the task of finding entities in scientific publications as a
sequence labeling problem, where each input word is classified as being
of a dedicated semantic type or not. In order to handle entities related
to our domain, we train a CRF based machine learning classifier with
major semantic classes, (see Table 8.4, using training material
from the ACL RD-TEC 2.0 dataset (QasemiZadeh and Schumann, 2016). Apart
from this, we follow a domain adaptation approach inspired by (Agerri
and Rigau, 2016) and ingest semantic background knowledge extracted from
external scientific corpora, in particular the ACL Anthology (Bird et
al., 2008; Gildea et al., 2018). We perform entity linking by means of a
new gazetteer based on th SAGE dictionary of Social Research
Methods (Lewis-Beck et al., 2003), thus putting a special emphasis on
the social sciences. The linking component addresses the synonymy
problem and matches an entity despite name variations such as spelling
variations. Finally, term filtering is carried out based on termhood and
unithood, while scoring is achieved by calculating a relevance score
based on TF-IDF (cf Table 8.6).

Our research experiments are based on publications from the Social
Science Open Access Repository (SSOAR)\[20\] as well as the train and
test data of the Rich Context Competition corpus\[21\]. Our work extends
previous work on this topic (cf. (Eckle-Kohler et al., 2013)) in various
ways: First, we do not limit our study to abstracts, but use the entire
fulltext. Second, we focus on a broader range of semantic classes, i.e.
*Research Method*, *Research Theory*, *Research Tool* and *Research
Measurement*, tackling also the problem of identifying novel entities.


#### Distributed semantic models

For domain adaptation, we integrate further background knowledge. We use
topical information from word embeddings trained on an scientific corpus
as an additional feature to our NER model. For this, we use
agglomerative clustering of the word embeddings to identify topical
groups of words. The cluster number of each word is used as additional
sequential input feature for our CRF model. Semantic representations of
words are a successful extension of common features, resulting in higher
NER performance (Turian et al., 2010) and can be trained offline. In
this work, the word vectors were learned based on 22,878 documents of
the scientific ACL Anthology Reference Corpus\[22\] using Gensim\[23\]
with the skip-gram model (cf. (Mikolov et al., 2013)) and a
pre-clustering algorithm\[24\].

#### Features

The features incorporated into the linear chain CRF are shown in the
Table 8.5. The features depend mainly on
the observations and on pairs of adjacent labels, using a log-linear
combination. However, since simple token level training of CRFs leads to
poor performance, more effective text features such as word shape,
orthographic, gazetteer, Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags, along with word
clustering have been used.

| **Type**                 |                            **Features**                            |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------: |

| **POS unigrams**         |                \(p_{i}\), \(p_{i-1}\), \(p_{i-2}\)                 |

Table 8.5: Features used for NER.

#### Knowledge resources

We use the SAGE thesaurus which includes well-defined concepts, an
explicit taxonomic hierarchy between concepts as well as labels that
specify synonyms of the same concept. A portion of terms is unique to
the social science domain (e. g., ‘dependent interviewing’), while
others are drawn from related disciplines such as statistics (e. g.,
‘conditional likelihood ratio test’)\[25\]. However, since the
thesaurus is not exhaustive and covers only the top-level concepts
related to social science methods, our aim was to extend it by
automatically extracting further terms from domain-specific texts, in
particular from the Social Science Open Access Repository. More
concretely, we carried out the following steps to extend SAGE as an
off-line step. For step 2 and 3, candidate terms have been extracted by
our pipeline for the entire SSOAR corpus.

1.  Assignment of semantic types to concepts (manual)

2.  Extracting terms variants such as abbreviations, synonyms, related
    terms from SSOAR (semi-automatic)

3.  Computation of term and document frequency scores for SSOAR
    (automatic)

#### Extracting term variants such as abbreviations, synonyms, and related terms

26,082 candidate terms have been recognized and classified by our
pipeline and manually inspected to a) find synonyms and related words
that could be linked to SAGE, and b) build a post-filter for incorrectly
classified terms. Moreover, abbreviations have been extracted using the
algorithm of Schwartz and Hearst (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003). This way,
a Named Entity gazetteer could be built and is used at run-time. It
comprises 1,111 terms from SAGE and 447 terms from the used glossary of
statistical terms\[26\] as well as 54 previously unseen terms detected
by the model-based classifier.

#### Computation of term and document frequency scores

Term frequency statistics have been calculated off-line for the entire
SSOAR corpus. The term frequency at corpus level will be used at run
time to determine the term relevance at the document level by
calculating the TF-IDF scores. The most relevant terms from SAGE are
listed in Table 8.6.

Table 8.6: Most relevant terms from SAGE by Semantic Type.

#### Definition of a relevance score

Relevance of terminology is often assessed using the notion of
*unithood*, i.e. ‘the degree of strength or stability of syntagmatic
combinations of collections’, and *termhood*, i.e. ‘the degree that a
linguistic unit is related to domain-specific concepts’ (Kageura and
Umino, 1996). Regarding *unithood*, the NER model implicitly contains
heuristics about legal POS tag sequences for candidate terms, consisting
of at least one noun (NN), preceeded or followed by modifiers such as
adjectives (JJ), participles (VB\*) or cardinal numbers (CD),
complemented by wordshape features.

In order to find out if the candidate term also fulfills the *termhood*
requirement, domain-specific term frequency statistics have been
computed on the SSOAR repository, and set in contrast to general domain
vocabulary terms. It has to be noted that only a small portion of the
social science terms is actually unique to the domain (e.g., ‘dependent
interviewing’), while others might be drawn from related disciplines
such as statistics (e.g., ‘conditional likelihood ratio test’).

#### Preliminary results

Our method has been tested on 100 fulltext papers from SSOAR and ten
documents from the Rich Context Competition (RCC), all randomly selected
from a hold out corpus. In our experiments on SSOAR Social Science
publications, we compared results to the given metadata information. The
main finding was that while most entities from the SAGE thesaurus could
be extracted and linked reliably (e.g., ’Paired t-test’), they could not
be easily mapped to the SSOAR metadata terms, which consist of only a
few abstract classes (e.g., ’quantitative analysis’). Furthermore, our
tool was tested by the RCC organizer, were the judges reviewed ten
random publications and generated qualitative scores for each document.
In this evaluation, the research method extraction tool received the
overall best results of all competitors for this task.\[27\]

## 5. Research field classification

### 5.1 Task description

The goal of this task is to identify the research fields covered in the
social science publications. In general, two approaches could be applied
to this task. One is the extraction of relevant terms of the
publications. It means that this task could be seen as a keyword
extraction task and the detected terms considered as descriptive terms
regarding the research field. The second approach is to learn to
classify publications research fields with the use of annotated data in
a superviesed manner. The benifit of the second approach is that the
classification scheme to describe the research field can be defined by
experts of the domain. The disadvantage of supervised trained
classifiers for this task is the lack of applicable training data.
Furthermore, it must be ensured that the training data is comparable to
the texts the research field classifier should be applied on.

#### Formal problem definition

Let \(P\) denote a set of publications of size \(n\), \(A\) a set of
corresponding abstracts of the same size and \(L\) a set of \(k\)
defined class labels describing research fields. The task of research
field classification is to select for each publication \(p_i\in{P}\)
based on the information contained in the corresponding abstract
\(a_i\in{A}\) a set of labels
\(C_i = \varnothing \cap \{c_1\dots c_n|c_n \in L\}\) of \(n\) labels.
The number of \(n\) denotes the number of labels from \(L\) describing
the research field of \(a_i\) and can vary for each publication \(p_i\).
If there is no label \(l_k\) representing the information given by the
abstract \(a_i\) the set of class labels is the empty set
\(\varnothing\).

### 5.2 Our approach

Since we didn’t receive any gold standard for this task during the
competition we decided to make use of external resources. We decided to
use an external labeled dataset to train a text classifier which is able
to predict one or moreresearch label for a given abstract of a
publication.

The publications given througout the competition belongs to the domain
of social sciences we considered metadata from a open access repository
for the social sciences called SSOAR. The advantages are twofold. On the
one hand, we could rely on professional annotations in a given
classification scheme covering the social sciences and related areas. On
the other hand the source is openly available.\[28\]

The annotated data of SSOAR contains four different annotation schemes
for research field related information. By reviewing these schemes, we
decided to use the Classification Social Science (classoz) annotation
scheme. The number of classes in each schema, coverage of each
classification, and the distribution of data in each schema affected our
decision. An exhausitve description of the used data can be found in
Section 8.2.

#### Pre-processing and model architecture

SSOAR is a multilingual repository. Therefore, the available abstracts
may vary in language and the language of the abstract may differ from
the language of the article itself. We selected all English abstract
with valid classification as our dataset. Mainly because of the language
of the RCC corpus. However, it should be noted that the multilingual
SSOAR abstract corpus has a skewed distribution of languages with
English and German as the main languages. We count 22,453 English
abstracts with valid classification after filtering. Due to the unequal
distribution of labels in the dataset, we need to guaranty enough
training data for each label. We selected only labels with frequency
over 300 for training the model, which results in a total of 44 out of
154 classification labels representing research fields. For creating
train and test set, 22,453 SSOAR publications with their assigned labels
were split randomly. We used a train/validation/test split of 70/10/20.
We decided to train a text classifier based on a fasttext (Joulin et
al., 2017) model in the author’s implementation. The arguments to use
this model was the speed in comparison to a more complex neural net
architecture and the still comparable to state of the art performance
(e.g.(Wang et al., 2018)). The model is trained with learning rate 1.0
for 150 epochs. Also, the negative sampling parameter is set to 25.

### 5.3 Evaluation

Figure 8.3 shows the performance of the model regarding various evaluation metrics
for different thresholds. A label is assigned to a publication if the
model outputs a probability for the label above the defined threshold.
In multi-label classification, this allows us to evaluate our model from
different perspectives. As illustrated in figure 8.3,
the intersection of the micro precision and the micro recall curves is
at the threshold of 0.1, where the highest micro f1 score is achieved.
By increasing the threshold from this point, the micro-precision score
is increasing, but the micro recall is falling. By decreasing threshold,
these trends are inverted. Also, the default threshold of 0.5 doesn’t
look promising. In spite of micro-precision about 0.75, we have a
problem with the very high number of items without any prediction. In
respect to this observation it is advantageous to select a lower
threshold in a productive environment. The curve named *without
prediction* shows for a given threshold the share of publications in the
test set without any prediction. If the selected threshold value is
high, the number of publications for which the model cannot predict a
research field increases. For example, a selected threshold value of
0.55 leads to 40% unclassified publications in the test set. The *one
correct* named curve indicates the quality of the publication wise
prediction. It shows the share of all publications in the test set where
at least one of the predicted research field labels can be found in the
ground truth data. For instance, if a threshold of 0.1 is selected for
75% of the publications in the test set, at least one of the model
predictions are correct. This value decreases with increasing threshold
simmilar to the recall metric. The final micro f1 value on the test set
for our model and a selected threshold of 0.1 is 0.56 (precison 0.55,
recall 0.56).

set).

## 6. Discussions and Limitations

### 6.1 Dataset Extraction.

For the dataset extraction task, the proposed methods are only tested on
social science related data. The performance measures we have introduced
are based on a hold out data set of our automatically created dataset.
Especially the recall may be biased given that our training as well as
testing data is biased towards known datasets, where datasets not yet
part of our reference set are not considered.

The results of the second phase presented during the RCC workshop\[29\]
are showing good performance of our approach in comparison to the other
finalist teams with the highest precision 52.2% (second: 47.0%) and
second in recall (ours: 20.5, best: 34.8%). With respect to F1, our
approach provides the second best performing system for this task
(29.5%, 40.0% for first place). The results on the manually created hold
out set underline, that our system performs better in respect to
precision in comparison to the other finalist teams. Given that our
models are supervised through a corpus of social sciences publications,
we anticipate limited generalisability across other disciplines and plan
to investigate this aspect as part of future work. In this context, the
focus of our training data towards survey data, also reflected in
dataset titles such as *Current Population Survey*, could have biased
the model to detect the survey as a specific type of research datasets
better than other subtypes like e.g. text corpora in the NLP community.
In general, however, our approach to using a weakly labeled corpus
created from a list of dataset names could be applied in other research
domains.

### 6.2 Research method extraction.

We consider the extraction of research methods from full text as a
particularly challenging task because the sample vocabulary given by the
RCC organizers covers a large thematic variety of areas. The task itself
was defined as the identification of research methods associated with a
specific publication, which in turn are drawn from a specific research
field. Since no training data has been provided, we created and
annotated a new corpus for the task and trained a CRF model, adding
lexical resources. The qualitative reviews during the two phases of the
competition attested that this approach works fine.

### 6.3 Research field classification.

Our supervised machine learning approach to handle the research field
classification task performs well on the dataset created from social
science publication metadata. A micro F1 measure of above 55% seems to
indicate reasonable performance considering the small dataset with
44 labels and a mean number of keywords of three terms per publication.
As one example of multilabel classification with a comparable size of
labels we would like to mention the classification of texts in the
domain of medicine presented in (Wang et al., 2018). The models tested
by the authors on the task of multilabel prediction from 50 different
labels leads to micro F1 values between 53% and 62%.
Considering the evaulation approach, focused on publications from the
social sciences, the generalisability across other disciplines remains
unclear and requires further research. Even though the used
classification scheme may cover neighbouring disciplines, for instance,
medicine, the numbers of samples of the training data covering other
research fields than the social science is limited. Our pragmatic
approach of basing our classifications on the abstract of the
publications makes it applicable even in scenarios where the full-text
of publications is not accessible.

## 7. Conclusion

This chapter has provided an overview on our solutions submitted to the
Rich Context Competition 2018. Aimed at improving search, discovery and
interpretability of scholarly resources, we are addressing three
distinct tasks all aimed at extracting structured information about
research resources from scientitifc publications, namely the extraction
of dataset mentions, the extraction of mentions of research methods and
the classification of research fields.

In order to address all aforementioned challenges, our pipelines make
use of a range of preprocessing techniques together with
state-of-the-art NLP methods as well as supervised machine learning
approaches tailored towards the specific nature of scholarly
publications as well as the dedicated tasks. In addition, background
datasets have been used to facilitate supervision of methods at larger
scale.

Our results indicate both significant opportunities for automating the
aforementioned three tasks but also their challenging nature, in
particular given the lack of publicly available gold standards for
training and testing. Aggregating and publishing such data has been
identified as important activity for future work, and is a prerequisite
for significantly advancing state-of-the-art methods.

# Chapter 9 - Finding datasets in publications: The University of Paderborn approach

Abstract
=================

The steadily increasing number of publications available to researchers
    makes it difficult to keep track of the state of the art. In particular,
    tracking the datasets used, topics addressed, experiments performed and
    results achieved by peers becomes increasingly tedious. Current academic
    search engines render a limited number of entries pertaining to this
    information. However, having this knowledge would be beneficial for
    researchers to become acquainted with all results and baselines relevant
    to the problems they aim to address. With our participation in the NYU
    Coleridge Initiative’s Rich Context Competition, we aimed to provide
    approaches to automate the discovery of datasets, research fields and
    methods used in publications in the domain of Social Sciences. We
    trained an Entity Extraction model based on Conditional Random Fields
    and combined it with the results from a Simple Dataset Mention Search to
    detect datasets in an article. For the identification of Fields and
    Methods, we used word embeddings. In this chapter, we describe how our
    approaches performed, their limitations, some of the encountered
    challenges and our future agenda.

Literature Review
=================

Previous works on information retrieval from scientific articles are
mainly seen in the field of Bio-medical Sciences and Computer Science,
with systems [@DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18] built using the
MEDLINE[^1] abstracts, full-text articles from PubMed Central[^2] or ACL
Anthology dataset[^3]. The documents belonging to the above-mentioned
datasets follow a similar format, and thus, several metadata and
bibliographical extraction frameworks like CERMINE [@tkaczyk2014cermine]
have been built on them. However, since articles belonging to the domain
of Social Sciences do not follow a standard format, extracting key
sections and metadata using already existing frameworks like
GROBID [@lopez2009grobid], ScienceParse[^4] or
ParsCit [@councill2008parscit] did not seem as viable options, majorly
because these systems were still under development and lacked certain
desired features. Hence, building upon the approach of Westergaard et.
al [@DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18], we built our own
sections-extraction framework for dataset detection and research fields
and methods identification.

Apart from content and metadata extraction, key-phrase or topic
extraction from scientific articles has been another emerging research
problem in the domain of information retrieval from scientific articles.
Jansen et al. [@jansen2016extracting] extracted core claims from
scientific articles by first detecting keywords and key-phrases using
rule-based, statistical, machine learning and domain-specific approaches
and then applying document summarization techniques. For characterizing
a research work in terms of its focus, application domain and techniques
used, Gupta et al. [@gupta2011analyzing] proposed applying semantic
extraction patterns to the dependency trees of sentences in an article’s
abstract. On the other hand, to thematically represent scientific
articles and for ranking the extracted key-phrases, Mahata et
al. [@mahata2018key2vec] devised an approach for processing text
documents to train phrase embeddings.

The problem of dataset detection and methods and fields identification
is not only different from the ones mentioned above, but also our
approach for tackling it is radically disparate. The following sections
describe our approach in detail.

Project Architecture
====================

![Data Flow Pipeline: Red lines depict the flow of given and generated
files between components whereas black lines represent the generation of
final output
files[]{data-label="fig:flowchart"}](combined_images/flowchart_paper.pdf){width="\textwidth"}

Our pipeline (shown in Figure \[fig:flowchart\]) consisted of three main
components: 1) Preprocessing, 2) Fields and Methods Identification and
3) Dataset Extraction. The Preprocessing module read the text from
publications and generated some additional files (see
Section \[preprocess\] for details). These files along with the given
Fields and Methods vocabularies were used to infer Research Fields and
Methods from the publications. Then, the information regarding Research
Fields was passed onto the Dataset Detection module and using the
Dataset Vocabulary, Dataset Citations and Mentions were identified. The
following sections provide a detailed overview of each of these
components.

Preprocessing
=============

As discussed in Chapter 5, the publications were provided in two
formats: PDF and text. For Phase-1, we used the given text files,
however during Phase-2, we came across many articles in the training
files that had not been properly converted to text and contained mostly
non-ASCII characters. To work with such articles, we relied on the open
source tool `pdf2text` from `poppler suite`[^5] to extract text from
PDFs. The `pdf2text` command served as the first preprocessing step and
was called as a subprocess from within a python script. It was used with
`-nopgbrk` argument to generate the text files.

Once we had the text files, we followed the rule-based approach as
proposed by Westergaard et al. [@DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18]
for pre-processing. The following series of operations based mostly on
regular expressions were performed:

-   Words split by hyphens were de-hyphenated

-   Irrelevant data was removed (i.e., equations, tables,
    acknowledgment, references);

-   Main sections (i.e., abstract, keywords, JEL-Classification,
    methodology/data, summary, conclusion) were identified and
    extracted;

-   Noun phrases from these sections were extracted (using the python
    library, spaCy[^6]).

We came up with the heuristics for identifying the main sections after
going through the articles from different domains in the training data.
We collected the surface forms for the headings of all major sections
(abstract, keywords, introduction, data, approach, summary, discussion)
and applied regular expressions to search for them and separate them
from one another. The headings and their corresponding content were
stored as key-value pairs in a file. For generating noun-phrases, this
file was parsed and for all the values (content) in key-value
(heading-content) pairs, a spaCy object, `doc`, was created
sentence-wise. Using the built-in function for extracting noun chunks
([`doc.noun_chunks`]{}), we generated key-value pairs of heading and
noun-phrases found in the content and stored them in another file. This
file was later used for fields and methods identification.

To determine how well our approach performed in distinguishing sections,
we evaluated it on the articles in the validation dataset. During
evaluation, we figured out the limiting cases of our approach. A section
could not be differentiated either when there was no explicit mention of
any of its surface forms or if there were multiple mentions of the
surface forms in the articles. For instance, in the validation dataset
(see Table \[tab:sections\]), keywords were not extracted from 13
articles because of no explicit mention of the term ’keywords’ or its
variants. On manual inspection, we found keywords were actually not
mentioned in these 13 articles. In the remaining articles where the
keywords were present, our algorithm could not detect them from 1
article. For brevity, we have reported only four main sections in
Table \[tab:sections\]: title, abstract, keywords and methodology/data,
since these are the ones getting preferential treatment in methods and
fields identification. If a section was not found in the article
(because of no explicit mention of any of the surface forms), then only
the sections that could be detected were extracted. The remaining
content was saved as `reduced_content` after cleaning and noun-phrases
were extracted from it to prevent loss of any meaningful data.

[C[4cm]{} C[3.5cm]{} C[4cm]{}]{} **Sections** & **No explicit mention**
& **Mentioned but not distinguished**  
Title & 0 & 0  
Keywords & 13 & 1  
Abstract & 0 & 1  
Methodology/Data & 18 & 4  

In addition to the main sections, we also extracted PDF metadata using
`pdfinfo` service from the `poppler suite` library. The metadata very
often contained the keywords and subject of an article, which was
helpful in those cases where the keywords were not found by the regular
expression.  
In the end, the preprocessing module generated four text files for a
publication: PDF-converted text, PDF-metadata, processed articles
containing relevant data, and noun phrases from the relevant sections,
respectively. These files were then passed on to the other two
components of the pipeline, which have been discussed below.

Approach
========

Research Fields and Methods Identification
------------------------------------------

### Vocabulary Generation and Model Preperation

1.  **Research Methods Vocabulary**: In Phase-1 of the challenge, we
    used the given methods vocabulary. However, the feedback that we
    received from Phase-1 evaluation gave more emphasis to statistical
    methods used by the authors, references to the time scope, unit of
    observation, and regression equations rather than the means used to
    compile the data, i.e., surveys. Since the given methods vocabulary
    was not a complete representation of statistical methods and also
    consisted terms depicting surveys, in Phase-2, we decided to create
    our own Research Methods Vocabulary using Wikipedia and DBpedia.[^7]
    We manually curated a list of all the relevant statistical methods
    from Wikipedia[^8] and fetched their descriptions from the
    corresponding DBpedia resources. For each label in the vocabulary,
    we extracted noun phrases from its description and added them to the
    vocabulary. Please refer Table \[tab:vocab\] for examples.

    Bayesian statistics, developed in 2004 by physicist John Skilling. &
    algorithm, a computational approach, the problem, comparing models,
    Bayesian statistics, physicist John Skilling  

2.  **Research Fields Vocabulary**: For both the phases, we used the
    given research fields vocabulary and, just like the methods
    vocabulary, supplemented it with the noun phrases from the
    description of the research field labels. However, since our phase-1
    model seemed to confuse fields with methods, for Phase-2, we
    additionally created a stopword-list of terms that didn’t contain
    any domain-specific information, such as; Mixed Methods, Meta
    Analysis, Narrative Analysis and the like.

3.  **Word2Vec Model generation**: In this pre-processing step, we used
    the above-mentioned vocabulary files containing noun phrases to
    generate a vector model for both research fields and methods. The
    vector model was generated by using the labels and noun phrases from
    the description of the available research fields and methods to form
    a sum vector. The sum vector was basically the sum of all the
    vectors of the words present in a particular noun phrase. 3em [The
    pre-trained Word2Vec model
    `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin` [@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781]
    was used to extract the vectors of the individual words.]{}

4.  **Research Method training results creation**: For research methods,
    we generated an intermediate result file with the publications
    present in the training data. It was generated using a
    `naïve finder algorithm` which, for each publication, selected the
    research method with the highest cosine similarity to any of its
    noun phrase’s vectors. This file was later used to assign weights to
    research methods using Inverse Document Frequency.

### Processing with Trained Models

-   **Finding Research Fields and Methods:** To find the research fields
    and methods for a given list of publications, we performed the
    following steps: (At first, Step 1 was executed for all the
    publications, thereafter Step 2 and 3 were executed iteratively for
    each publication).

    1.  **Naïve Research Method Finder run** - In this step, we executed
        the `naïve research method finding algorithm` (i.e. selected a
        research method based on the highest cosine similarity between
        vectors) against all the current publications and then merged
        the results with the existing result from the
        `research methods’ preprocessing step`. The combined result was
        then used to generate IDF weight values for each
        `research method`, to compute the significance of recurring
        terms.

    2.  **IDF-based Research Method Selection** - We re-ran the
        algorithm to find the closest research method to each noun
        phrase and then sorted the pairs based on their weighted cosine
        similarity. The weights were taken from the IDF values generated
        in the first step and the manual weights assigned (section-wise
        weighting). Here, the noun phrases that came from the
        methodology section and from the methods listed in
        JEL-classification (if present) were given a higher preference.
        The pair with the highest weighted cosine similarity was then
        chosen as the Research Method of the article.

    3.  **Research Field Finder run** - In this step, we first found the
        closest research field from each noun phrase in the publication.
        Then we selected the Top N (= 10) pairs that had the highest
        weighted cosine similarity. Afterwards, the noun phrases that
        had a similarity score less than a given threshold (= 0.9) were
        filtered out. The end-result was then passed on to a
        post-processing algorithm.  
        For weighted cosine similarity, the weights were assigned
        manually based on the section of publication from which the noun
        phrases came. In general, noun phrases from title and keywords
        (if present) were given a higher preference than other sections,
        since usually these two sections hold the crux of an article.
        Note, if sections could not be discerned from an article, then
        noun phrases from the section, reduced\_content (see section
        \[preprocess\]), were used to find both fields and methods.

    4.  **Research Field Selection** - The top-ranked term from the
        result of step 3, which was not present in the stopword-list of
        irrelevant terms, was marked as the research field of the
        article.

Dataset Extraction
------------------

For identifying the datasets in a publication, we followed two
approaches and later combined results from both. Both the approaches
have been described below.

1.  **Simple Dataset Mention Search:** We chose the dataset citations
    from the given Dataset Vocabulary that occurred for one dataset only
    and used these unique mentions to search for the corresponding
    datasets using regular expressions in the text documents. Then, we
    computed a frequency distribution of the datasets. As can be seen
    from Figure \[fig:graph\], certain dataset citations occurred more
    often than others. This is because while searching for dataset
    citations, apart from the dataset title, the corresponding
    mention\_list from Dataset Vocabulary was also considered, which
    contained many commonly occurring terms like ‘time’, ‘series’, ‘time
    series’, ‘population’ etc. Therefore, we filtered out those dataset
    citations that occurred more than a certain threshold value (=1.20)
    multiplied by the median of the frequency distribution and that had
    less than 3 distinct mentions in a publication. The remaining
    citations were written to an interim result file.
    Table \[tab:simple\] depicts the improvement in performance of
    Simple Dataset Mention Search with the inclusion of filtering. The
    filtering process improved the F1-measure by 42.86%. Note, as the
    validation data consisted of only 100 articles, changing the
    threshold value to 1.10 or 1.30 didn’t result in any significant
    change, hence we have maintained a constant threshold value of 1.20
    in our comparison table.

    [C[1.5cm]{} C[3.5cm]{} C[3.5cm]{} C[3.5cm]{}]{} **Metrics** &
    **without filtering** & **Threshold=1.20, mentions $<$ 3** &

    ![Frequency Distribution of Dataset
    Citations[]{data-label="fig:graph"}](combined_images/freq.pdf)

2.  **Rasa-based Dataset Detection:** In our second approach, we trained
    an entity extraction model based on conditional random fields (CRF)
    using Rasa NLU [@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1712-05181]. For training
    the model we used the Spacy Tokenizer[^9] for the preprocessing
    step. For Entity Recognition we used BILOU tagging and used 50
    iterations to train the CRF. We used the Part of Speech tags, the
    case of the input tokens and the suffixes of the tokens as input
    features for the CRF model. We particularly tested two
    configurations for training the CRF-based Named Entity Recognition
    (NER) model. In Phase-1, the 2500 labeled publications from the
    training dataset were used for training the Rasa NLU[^10] model.
    Later in Phase-2, when the Phase-1 holdout corpus was released, we
    combined its 5000 labeled publications with the previously given
    2500 labeled publications and then retrained the model again with
    these 7500 labeled publications.  
    **Running the CRF-Model:** The trained model was run against the
    preprocessed data to detect dataset citations and mentions. Only the
    entities that had a confidence score greater than a certain
    threshold value (= 0.72) were considered as dataset mentions. A
    dataset mention was considered as a citation only if it was found in
    the given Dataset Vocabulary (via string matching either with a
    dataset title or any of the terms in a dataset ‘mention\_list’) and
    if it belonged to the research field of the article. To check if a
    dataset belonged to the field of research, we found the cosine
    similarity of the terms in the ‘subjects’ field of the Dataset
    Vocabulary with the keywords and the identified Research Field of
    the article.

3.  **Combining the two approaches:** The output generated by the
    Rasa-based approach was first checked for irrelevant citations
    before a union was performed to combine the results. This was done
    by checking if a given dataset\_id occured more than a threshold
    value (= 1.20) multiplied by the median of the frequency
    distribution (same as the filtering process of the Simple Dataset
    Mention Search).

Note that, the threshold values mentioned above were set after some
experiments of trial and testing. For dataset extraction, the goal was
to keep the number of false positives low while not compromising the
true positives. For research methods and fields, a manual evaluation
(see the next section for details) was done to test if the results made
sense with the articles.

Evaluation
==========

We performed a quantitative evaluation for Dataset Extraction using the
evaluation script provided by the competition organizers (refer Chapter
5 for more details). This evaluation (see Table \[tab:dataset\]) was
carried out against the validation data, wherein we compared four
different configurations. As can be inferred from the table, there was
only a slight increase in performance for the Rasa-based model, when the
training samples were increased. However, combining it with the Simple
Dataset Mention Search, increased the performance by *19.42%*.
Interestingly, there was no improvement in performance in the combined
approach even when the training samples for the Rasa-based model were
increased. This might be because of the removal of frequently-occuring
terms from the Rasa-generated output, based on the frequency
distribution of dataset mentions as computed in the Simple Dataset
Mention Search.

For Research Fields and Methods, we carried out a qualitative evaluation
against 10 randomly selected articles from Phase-1 holdout corpus.
Tables \[tab:field\] and \[tab:method\] depict a comparison between the
predicted fields and methods in Phase-1 and Phase-2. In general, our
models returned a more granular output in the second phase, solely
because of the modifications we made in the vocabularies.

Discussion
==========

Throughout the course of this competition, we encountered several
challenges and limitations in all the three stages of the pipeline. In
the preprocessing step, the appropriate extraction of text from PDFs
turned out to be rather challenging. This was especially due to the
varied formats of the publications, which made the extraction of
specific sections—that contained all data relevant to our
work—demanding. As mentioned before, if there was no explicit mention of
the key-terms like
`Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Methodology/Data, Summary, Conclusion`
in the text, then the content was saved as ‘reduced\_content’ after
applying all other preprocessing steps and filtering out any irrelevant
data.  
Our experiments suggest that the labeled publications we received for
dataset detection were not uniform in the dataset mentions provided,
which made it difficult to train an entity extraction model even with an
increased number of training samples. Hence, there was only a slight
improvement in performance when the Rasa-model was trained with 7500
publications instead of 2500. This was also why we combined the
Rasa-based approach with the Simple Dataset Mention Search, so that at
least the datasets that were present in the vocabulary do not get
missed.

Regarding the fields and methods, vocabularies played an immense role in
their identification. The vocabularies that were provided by the SAGE
publications contained some terms that were either polysemous or very
high-level and therefore, were picked up by our model very often. Hence,
for research methods, we created our own vocabulary containing all the
relevant statistical methods, and for fields, we introduced a
stopword-list of irrelevant terms and looked it up each time, before
writing the result to the output file. The goal of stopword-list
generation was to filter the terms that did not carry domain-specific
information and sounded more like research methods than fields. Since
the focus was on more granulated results, we tried to look for open
ontologies for Social Science Fields and Methods and unfortunately,
could not find any. It is worth mentioning that since our approach for
Fields and Methods identification relied heavily upon vocabularies, it
could not find any new methods or fields from the publications.

Based on the final evaluation feedback, since our Phase-2 models did not
perform as good as we expected, following are a few things that we could
have done differently.

1.  For research methods, merging the given SAGE methods vocabulary with
    our manually curated vocabulary, could have resulted in methods that
    would have been both granular and statistical while still being
    relevant to the publications. Introducing a stopword-list just as we
    did for research field identification, could also have been another
    workaround.

2.  For both fields and methods identification, we could have also tried
    pre-trained embeddings from glove[^11] and fastText[^12].

3.  As our entity-extraction approach for Dataset Detection suffered
    from a limitation of inconsistent labels (i.e. datasets mentioned in
    the form of abbreviation, full-name, collection procedure, and
    keywords) in training data, we could have extended the Simple
    Dataset Mention Search to a pattern-oriented search based on
    handcrafted rules derived from sentence structure and other
    heuristics.

Future Agenda
=============

The data provided to us in the competition displayed a cornucopia of
inconsistencies even after human processing. We hence propose that
machine-aided methods for computing correct and complete structured
representation of publications are of central importance for scientific
research such as an Open Research Knowledge
Graph [@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1901-10816][@DBLP:conf/esws/BuscaldiDMOR19].
Previous works on never-ending learning have shown how humans and
extraction algorithms can work together to achieve high-precision and
high-recall knowledge extraction from unstructured sources. In our
future work, we hence aim to populate a **scientific knowledge graph**
based on never-ending learning. The methodology we plan to develop will
be domain-independent and rely on active learning to classify, extract,
link and publish scientific research artifacts extracted from
open-access papers. Inconsistency will be remedied by ontology-based
checks learned from other publications such as SHACL constraints which
can be manually or automatically added.[^13] The resulting graphs will

-   rely on advanced distributed storage for RDF to scale to the large
    number of publications available;

-   be self-feeding, i.e., crawl the web for potentially relevant
    content and make this content available for processing;

-   be self-repairing, i.e., be able to update previous extraction
    results based on insights gathered from new content;

-   be weakly supervised by humans (e.g. authors of publications), who
    would assist in correcting wrong hypotheses, thereby leveraging
    semi-supervised learning;

-   provide standardized access via W3C Standards such as SPARQL.

Having such knowledge graphs would make it easier for the researchers
(both young and veteran) to easily follow along with their domain of
fast-paced research and eliminate the need to manually update the
domain-specific ontologies for fields, methods and other metadata as new
research innovations come up.

## Abstract

With the vast number of datasets and literature collections available for research today, it is very difficult to keep track on the use of datasets and literature articles for scientific research and discovery. Many datasets and research work using them are left undiscovered and under-utilized due to the lack of available search tools to automatically find out who worked with the data, on what research topics, using what research methods and generating what results. The Coleridge Rich Context Competition (RCC) therefore aims to build automated dataset discovery tools for analyzing and searching social science research publications. In this chapter, we describe our approach to solving the first phase of Coleridge Rich Context Competition.


## Introduction


Automated discovery from scientific research publications is an important task for analysts, researchers, and learners as they develop the scientific knowledge and use them to gain new insights. More specifically, on the tasks of discovering datasets and methods mentioned in a research publication, we have seen a lack of available tools to easily find who else worked on a particular dataset, what research methods people apply on the dataset, and what results they have found using the dataset. Furthermore, new datasets are not easy to discover, and as a result, good datasets and methods are often neglected.

The Coleridge Rich Context Competition (RCC) aims to build automated datasets discovery from social science research publications, filling the gap of this problem. In this competition, given a corpus of social science research publications, we have to automatically identify datasets used, and then infer the research methods and research fields in the publications. Note that no labeled data are given for research methods and fields identification.

We describes our submission to the first phase of RCC. We perform dataset detection followed by implicit entity linking approach to tackle dataset extraction task. We adopt weakly supervised classification for research methods and fields identification tasks utilizing external resource SAGE Knowledge as proxy for weak labels.

<!-- This manuscript describes summary of our submission for the first phase
of RCC. We begin with related work in section \[sec:relatedwork\]. We
present our analysis on RCC dataset in section \[sec:data\], describe
our approach in section \[sec:methods\], and discuss our experiment
results in section \[sec:experiments\]. Finally, we wrap up with
conclusion and future work in section \[sec:conclusion\].

## Related Work

Extracting information from scientific text has been explored in the past [[PM04](#PM04); [NCKL15](#NCKL15); [SBP<sup>+</sup>16](#SBP+16)]. One type of information extraction from scientific articles is extracting keyphrases and relation between them [[ADR<sup>+</sup>17](#ADR+17)]. Luan et al. (2017) propose semi-supervised sequence tagging approach to extract keyphrases [[LOH17](#LOH17)]. Augenstein and Søgaard (2017) explore multi-task deep recurrent neural network approach with several auxiliary tasks to extract keyphrases [[AS17](#AS17)].

Another type of extraction is citation extraction. Two citation extraction settings have been explored before: reference mining inside the full text [[ACK18](#ACK18)], and citation metadata extraction [[Het08](#Het08); [APBM14](#APBM14); [AGJ<sup>+</sup>17](#AGJ+17)]. Nasar er al. (2018) write a survey on information extraction from scientific articles [[NJM18](#NJM18)].

Recently, there are some work to explore dataset extraction from
scientific text [[BREM12](#BREM12); [GML<sup>+</sup>16](#GML+16); [GMVL16](#GMVL16)]. Boland et al. (2012) propose weakly supervised pattern induction to identify references in social science publications [[BREM12](#BREM12)]. Ghavimi et al. (2016) propose a semi automatic approach for detecting dataset references for social science texts [[GML<sup>+</sup>16](#GML+16); [GMVL16](#GMVL16)]. Dataset extraction is a challenging task because of the inconsistency and wide range of dataset mention styles in research publications [[GMVL16](#GMVL16)].

## Data Analysis

The first phase of RCC dataset consists of a labeled corpus of 5,000 publications for training set, and additional 100 publications for development set. The RCC organizer keeps a separate corpus of 5,000 publications for evaluation. Each article in the dataset contains full text article and dataset citation labels. The metadata of cited datasets in the corpus are also provided. For research methods and fields, no label information is provided, only SAGE social science research method graph and research fields vocabulary are provided. More details on RCC dataset and competition design can be read on chapter 5.

#### Preprocessing

In order to reliably access important structures of paper publications, we parse all papers using AllenAI Science Parse ([https://github.com/allenai/science-parse](https://github.com/allenai/science-parse)) [[AGB<sup>+</sup>18](#AGB+18)]. AllenAI Science Parse reads PDF file, and returns title, authors, abstract, sections, and bibliography (references). Since this parser utilizes machine learning models to parse PDF file, the parsing results may not be 100% accurate. Furthermore, this parser is unable to parse scan copy of old publication. In the situation where we are unable to access parsed fields, we fall back to the given text files.

#### Mention Analysis

There are 5,499 and 123 dataset citations in training and development set respectively. Among these citations, 320 citations in training set and 6 citations in development set do not have mentions information. We analyze the paper sections where the dataset mentions commonly occur. Table [10.1](#user-content-tab_train_top_sections) and [10.2](#user-content-tab_dev_top_sections) show top 12 most common sections mentioning dataset in training and development set. The tables suggest that abstract, reference titles, discussion, results, and methods are the most common sections where the dataset mentions occur. We exploit reference titles for dataset extraction.

#### Citation Analysis

We build citation network from training set. Each node in the network is a paper publication, and an edge between two node <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A" title="A" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?B" title="B" /> is generated if a paper <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A" title="A" /> cites paper <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?B" title="B" />. Table [10.3](#user-content-tab_network_stats) shows the statistics of the citation network.


<a name="tab_network_stats">Table 10.3</a>: Statistics of Citation Network

| | |
--------------- | -------:
Number of nodes | 5,000
Number of edges | 1,222
Network density | 0.0098%


Initially, we propose an approach utilizing citation network based on an intuition that datasets, research methods, and research fields are shared by: 1) same or similar issues, 2) same or similar context, 3) same or similar authors and communities, 4) same or similar metrics used in the publication. However, based on table [10.3](#user-content-tab_network_stats), we learn that exploring rich context using paper-paper citation network is not viable at this stage because most papers listed in publications’ bibliography are not available in the training set, and therefore, paper-paper citation network becomes very sparse with many unknown information. Figure [10.1](#fig_citation_graph) shows the visualization of citation network. As we can see in the citation network visualization, most papers only have one edge, although the average number of papers in bibliography list is 34.5. Furthermore, only 1,466 out of 5,000 publications are not isolated (having at least one bibliography paper in training data). Due to this reason, we drop our idea on utilizing paper-paper citation network at this stage. Nevertheless, we believe that bibliography contains important signals and information about datasets, and research fields.

## Methods

In this section, we describe our approach for RCC tasks: dataset extraction, research methods identification, and research fields identification.

#### Dataset Extraction

We employ a pipeline of two subtasks for dataset extraction: dataset detection, followed by dataset recognition. The goal of dataset detection is to detect whether a publication cites a dataset or not. This first subtask helps us to quickly filter out non-dataset publications. After the first subtask, we mine dataset mentions for the remaining publications in dataset recognition subtask.

For dataset detection, we utilize paper title in bibliography (reference list) combined with explicit research methods mentions to detect whether a publication citing a dataset or not. Explicit research methods mentions are determined based on exact match between paper title and SAGE research methods vocabulary. We train an SVM classifier using explicit research method mentions and n-gram features from paper titles in bibliography. We use the SVM classifier to classify each publication, if the classifier gives positive label, then we proceed to dataset recognition subtask, otherwise we ignore the publication.

For dataset recognition, we use an implicit entity linking approach. We start with the Naive Bayes model, which can be regarded as a standard information retrieval baseline, and entity indicative weighting strategy is used to improve the model. In order to calculate the word distribution of each dataset, we represent each dataset using its title, dataset mentions (provided in the training set), and dataset relevant sentences, filtered from the relevant publications using the rule based approach proposed in [[GMVL16](#GMVL16)]. All these texts related to a particular dataset are considered as a single string, and we calculate the word distribution as follows. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$\textbf{w}$" title="$\textbf{w}$" /> be the set of words in a dataset. In our problem setting, we assume the dataset prior probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(d)" title="p(d)" /> to be uniform. The probability of dataset <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d" title="d" /> given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$$w$&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}$" title="$$w$ \in \textbf{w}$" /> is:

<!-- $$\begin{split}
    p(d|\textbf{w}) & \propto \prod _{w \in \textbf{w}} p(w|d) \\
    & = \prod _{w \in \textbf{w}} \frac{f(d,w) + \gamma }{ \sum_{w'} f(d,w') + |W| \gamma}
\end{split}$$ -->
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\begin{align*}&space;p(d|\textbf{w})&space;&&space;\propto&space;\prod&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;p(w|d)&space;\\&space;&&space;=&space;\prod&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\frac{f(d,w)&space;&plus;&space;\gamma&space;}{&space;\sum_{w'}&space;f(d,w')&space;&plus;&space;|W|&space;\gamma}&space;\end{align*}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\begin{align*}&space;p(d|\textbf{w})&space;&&space;\propto&space;\prod&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;p(w|d)&space;\\&space;&&space;=&space;\prod&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\frac{f(d,w)&space;&plus;&space;\gamma&space;}{&space;\sum_{w'}&space;f(d,w')&space;&plus;&space;|W|&space;\gamma}&space;\end{align*}" title="\begin{align*} p(d|\textbf{w}) & \propto \prod _{w \in \textbf{w}} p(w|d) \\ & = \prod _{w \in \textbf{w}} \frac{f(d,w) + \gamma }{ \sum_{w'} f(d,w') + |W| \gamma} \end{align*}" /></a>

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f(d,&space;w)" title="f(d, w)" /> is the number of co-occurrences of word <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" /> with entity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d" title="d" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\gamma" title="\gamma" /> is the smoothing parameter, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?|W|" title="|W|" /> is the vocabulary size. For each dataset <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d" title="d" />, we derive <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f(d,&space;w)" title="f(d, w)" /> by the count of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" /> occurrences in the text extracted for each dataset. In order to stress more priority for dataset indicative words, we improved the final objective function of our model as follows:

<!-- $$ln(p(d|\textbf{w})) \propto \sum _{w \in \textbf{w}} \beta(w) * ln(p(w|d))$$ -->
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$$ln(p(d|\textbf{w}))&space;\propto&space;\sum&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\beta(w)&space;*&space;ln(p(w|d))$$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$$ln(p(d|\textbf{w}))&space;\propto&space;\sum&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\beta(w)&space;*&space;ln(p(w|d))$$" title="$$ln(p(d|\textbf{w})) \propto \sum _{w \in \textbf{w}} \beta(w) * ln(p(w|d))$$" /></a>

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta(w)" title="\beta(w)" /> is the entity-indicative weight for word <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" />. This weight <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta(w)" title="\beta(w)" /> is added as an exponent to the term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(w|d)" title="p(w|d)" />. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta(w)" title="\beta(w)" /> is calculated as:

<!-- $$\beta(w) = log(1 + E / df(w))$$ -->
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$$\beta(w)&space;=&space;log(1&space;&plus;&space;E&space;/&space;df(w))$$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$$\beta(w)&space;=&space;log(1&space;&plus;&space;E&space;/&space;df(w))$$" title="$$\beta(w) = log(1 + E / df(w))$$" /></a>

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E" title="E" /> is the number of distinct datasets considered and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?df(w)" title="df(w)" /> counts the number of datasets with at least one occurrence of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" />. This model can be trained efficiently, and training the model on RCC dataset needs approximately 5 minutes.

Then for a given unseen publication, we use same rule based approach [[GMVL16](#GMVL16)] to filter a few relevant sentences, and datasets are ranked by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?ln(p(d|w))" title="ln(p(d|w))" /> to select the most suitable datasets. In order to select exact datasets related to particular publication, we select top 10 datasets ranked using above approach. And then the confidence probability related to the top 10 datasets are normalized and select the datasets with the normalized probability higher than a predefined threshold value. We return the entity indicative words as relevant dataset mentions.

#### Research Methods Identification

Since we do not have labeled training data for this task, we use explicit research method mentions (based on exact match with SAGE research methods vocabulary) in a publication as weak signals on research methods used in the publication. When these mentions frequently appear in a publication, there is a high chance that this publication is using these particular research methods.

Based on this intuition, we generate training set for research method classification utilizing sentences that explicitly mention research method in a publication. Publication title and the sentences mentioning research method serve as context information of a specific research method. In order to reduce noisy weak signals, we apply minimum support of three sentences in a publication. We exclude research methods which only being mentioned one or two times in a publication. We also exclude research methods that only being mentioned in less than 10 different publications from the training set. Finally, we have 133 research methods having sufficient context information for training data. This number is 20.18% of 659 research methods in SAGE research method graph.

We use the training data to train logistic regression classifier to classify research methods from publication title and sentences. We utilize n-gram features from publication title and sentences for the classifier. We apply the logistic regression classifier to recommend top 3 research methods based on logistic regression probability score.

This approach can be extended by utilizing research method graph to expand the context. Context information does not only comes from sentences in publication, but also comes from related research methods as well as broader concept information. By using this information, we can potentially expand to more than 133 research methods and perform more accurate prediction.

#### Research Fields Identification

Similar to research methods identification, this task does not have labeled training data. We only have access to list of SAGE research fields. SAGE research fields are organized hierarchically into three levels, namely L1, L2, and L3, for example: Soc-2-4 (*kinship*) is under Soc (*sociology*) in L1, and under Soc-2 (*anthropology*) in L2.

To gain more understanding about the characteristic of each field, we crawl top search results from SAGE Knowledge[<sup>2</sup>](http://sk.sagepub.com/browse/). From the search result snippets, we collect information such as title and abstract on various publications including case, major work, books, handbooks, and dictionary. We exclude video and encyclopedia. Due to sparseness of the SAGE Knowledge, we exclude all research fields with less than 10 search results. In the end, we have samples of 414 L3 research fields under 101 L2 research fields and 10 L1 research fields. This numbers cover 20.87% of 1,984 L3 research fields, and 67.79% of 149 L2 research fields in the list of SAGE research fields. We use this data to train research fields classifiers.

We build three SVM classifiers for L1, L2, and L3 to classify a publication using paper title and abstract. Instead of taking the highest score, we take top-k research fields and perform re-ranking considering agreement among L1, L2, L3. We return a research field if its upper level are also in top ranks. Since level L1 is too general, we only output research fields from L2, and L3. We outline our heuristic to reorder the ranking below:

1.  Get top-5 L3 research fields, top-4 L2 research fields, and top-3 L1 research fields.

2.  Assign initial score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v" title="v" /> for each research field based on its
    ranking.

    <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=v(f_i)&space;=&space;(K&space;-&space;i)&space;/&space;K" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v(f_i)&space;=&space;(K&space;-&space;i)&space;/&space;K" title="v(f_i) = (K - i) / K" /></a>

    where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?K" title="K" /> is the length of top-k, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i" title="i" /> is the ranking of a research field <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f" title="f" />. For example, research fields in top-5 L3 have initial score of `[1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]`, top-4 L2 have initial score of `[1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25]`, and top-3 L1 have `[1, 0.666, 0.333]`

3.  Update the score by multiplying each score with the score of
    matching research fields at upper level, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?0" title="0" /> otherwise.

    <!-- $$score(f_i^l) =
            \begin{cases}
            \prod _{l \in L} v(f^l) & \text{if field matched} \\
            0 & \text{otherwise}
            \end{cases}$$  -->
    <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=score(f_i^l)&space;=&space;\begin{cases}&space;\prod&space;_{l&space;\in&space;L}&space;v(f^l)&space;&&space;\text{if&space;field&space;matched}&space;\\&space;0&space;&&space;\text{otherwise}&space;\end{cases}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?score(f_i^l)&space;=&space;\begin{cases}&space;\prod&space;_{l&space;\in&space;L}&space;v(f^l)&space;&&space;\text{if&space;field&space;matched}&space;\\&space;0&space;&&space;\text{otherwise}&space;\end{cases}" title="score(f_i^l) = \begin{cases} \prod _{l \in L} v(f^l) & \text{if field matched} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}" /></a>

    where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?L" title="L" /> is the level of research field <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f" title="f" /> and
    its upper levels. Here are examples of score update:
    -   Soc-2-4 at rank-2 in L3, Soc-2 at rank-3 in L2, and Soc at
        rank-1 in L1. In this case, the score of Soc-2-4 is
        `0.8 * 0.5 * 1 = 0.4`.
    -   Soc-2-4 at rank-1 in L3, Soc-2 at rank-2 in L2, but Soc is not found in top rank in L1. In this case, the score of Soc-2-4 is `0`.
4.  Collect score from L2 and L3, and exclude L2 if we see more specific of L2 in top-5 L3.

5.  Re-rank L2 and L3 research fields based on the score.

6.  Return research fields having score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?>=&space;0.4" title=">= 0.4" />.

To expand to more context from paper list in bibliography section, we also build other three Naive Bayes classifiers for L1, L2, and L3 using paper title feature only. We believe that a publication from a certain field also cites other publications from same or similar fields. For each publication in the bibliography, we apply the same procedure as mentioned above, then we average the score to get top research fields from bibliography. Finally, we combine top research fields from paper titles and abstract with results from bibliography.


## Experiment Results


We discuss our experiment results for each task in this section. We use standard precision, recall, and F1 as evaluation metrics.

#### Dataset Extraction

First, we analyze our experiment for dataset detection subtask comparing Naive Bayes and SVM classifier. Using only paper titles in bibliography and explicit research method mentions, Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers are able to reach 0.88 & 0.92 F1 score respectively. Since SVM outperforms Naive Bayes, we use SVM for our dataset detection module. Table [10.4](#user-content-tab_dd_dev_result) shows detail dataset detection results on development set.

<a name="tab_dd_dev_result">Table 10.4</a>: Dataset Detection Results on Development Set

Classifier | Prec. | Rec. | F1
---------- | ----: | ---: | ---:
Naive Bayes | 0.85 | 0.92 | 0.88
SVM | 0.96 | 0.88 | 0.92

To see the impact of performing dataset detection, we test the performance of dataset extraction with and without dataset detection on development set. Table [10.5](#user-content-tab_de_dev_result) summarizes the results. As shown in the table, performing dataset detection before extraction significantly improves the dataset extraction on development set.

<a name="tab_de_dev_result">Table 10.5</a>: Dataset Extraction Results on Development Set

Method | Prec. | Rec. | F1
------ | ----: | ---: | ---:
No Dataset Detection | 0.18 | 0.33 | 0.24
With Dataset Detection | 0.34 | 0.30 | 0.32

<a name="tab_de_test_result">Table 10.6</a>: Dataset Extraction Result on Test Set

Dataset | Prec. | Rec. | F1
------- | ----: | ---: | ---:
Test Set (phase1) | 0.17 | 0.10 | 0.13

Table [10.6](#user-content-tab_de_test_result) shows dataset extraction performance on test set (phase 1). The significant drop from development set result suggests that the test set might have different distribution compare to the training and development set. It might also contain dataset citations that are never been seen in training set. As mentioned in chapter 5, the test set contains new data source, non-open access journals from Sage publications which are not available in training and development set. It would be better to evaluate open access publications and non-open access publications separately so that we can have better understanding on the characteristics on each source in test set.

#### Research Methods Identification

We only consider Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers for research method identification because they naturally outputs probability score. We perform 5-fold cross validation to evaluate classification performance, and the result can be seen in table [10.7](#user-content-tab_rmethods_5cv). Logistic regression classifier outperforms Naive Bayes with 0.86 F1 score in classifying 133 research methods.

<a name="tab_rmethods_5cv">Table 10.7</a>: F1 Score for Research Method Classification

Classifier | F1
---------- | ---:
Naive Bayes | 0.55
Logistic Regression | 0.86

#### Research Fields Identification

We perform 5-fold cross validation to evaluate our classifiers to classify L1, L2, and L3 research fields. Table [10.8](#user-content-tab_rfields_pub_5cv) shows the results using n-gram features from paper title and abstract, whereas table [10.9](#user-content-tab_rfields_rt_5cv) shows the results using n-gram features from title only. Naive Bayes tends to perform slightly better on L3 research fields where we have large number of research field labels. We decide to use SVM for research field identification on publication level because SVM is generally better than Naive Bayes. On the other hand, we decide to use Naive Bayes for research field identification on bibliography level because Naive Bayes prefer to have more accurate L2 and L3 research fields.

<a name="tab_rfields_pub_5cv">Table 10.8</a>: F1 Score for Research Field Classification on Publication Level using Paper Title and Abstract

Classifier | L1 | L2 | L3
---------- | ----: | ---: | ---:
Naive Bayes | 0.78 | 0.37 | 0.13
SVM | 0.82 | 0.38 | 0.12

<a name="tab_rfields_rt_5cv">Table 10.9</a>: F1 Score for Research Field Classification on Bibliography Level using Paper Title Only

Classifier | L1 | L2 | L3
---------- | ----: | ---: | ---:
Naive Bayes | 0.80 | 0.35 | 0.12
SVM | 0.81 | 0.35 | 0.11


## Lesson Learned

Extraction of research datasets, associated research methods and fields from social science publication is challenging, yet an important problem to organize social science publications. We have described our approach for the RCC challenge, and table [10.10](#user-content-tab_summary) summarizes our approach. Beside publication content such as paper titles, abstract, full text, our approach also leverages on the information from bibliography. Furthermore, we also collect external information from SAGE Knowledge to get more information about research fields.

<a name="tab_summary">Table 10.10</a>: Summary of Our Approach

Method | Features (n-gram)
------ | -----------------
**Dataset extraction** ||
SVM for dataset detection | paper titles in bibliography and explicit research method mentions
Implicit entity linking | paper title and full text
**Research method identification** ||
Logistic regression | paper title, abstract, and full text
**Research field identification** ||
SVM (on paper) | paper title and abstract
Naive Bayes (on bibliography) | paper titles in bibliography

Apart from F1 score on 5-fold cross validation, we have no good way to evaluate research method and research field identification without ground truth label. Our methods are unable to automatically extract and recognize new datasets, research methods, and fields. An extension to automatically handle such cases using advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach is a promising future direction. All RCC finalists have shown that NLP approaches worked well on dataset extraction. Readers are encouraged to read their solutions on chapter 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Our model did not perform well in test set, and unable to advance to the second phase. Nevertheles, we recommend to use our approach as a baseline method as it is simple, efficient, and fast to train. From this competition, we have learned that lacks of labelled training data is a huge challenge, and it directs us to other external resources (i.e., SAGE Knowledge) as proxy for our label. We are also interested in exploring more advanced information extraction approaches on the RCC datasets. Another challenge is data sparsity. Although we see many papers listed in bibliography, lacks of access to these publication make us difficult to exploit citation network. Expanding labeled data from the list of papers in bibliography will be very beneficial to improve rich context of paper publications and datasets.

Abstract
========

Datasets are critical for scientific research, playing a role in
replication, reproducibility, and efficiency. Researchers have recently
shown that datasets are becoming more important for science to function
properly, even serving as artifacts of study themselves. However, citing
datasets is not a common or standard practice in spite of recent efforts
by data repositories and funding agencies. This greatly affects our
ability to track their usage and importance. A potential solution to
this problem is to automatically extract dataset mentions from
scientific articles. In this work, we propose to achieve such extraction
by using a neural network based on a BiLSTM-CRF architecture. Our method
achieves $F_{1}=0.885$ in social science articles released as part of
the Rich Context Dataset. We discuss future improvements to the model
and applications beyond social sciences.


Introduction
============

Science is fundamentally an incremental discipline that depends on
previous scientist's work. Datasets form an integral part of this
process and therefore should be shared and cited as any other scientific
output. This ideal is far from reality: the credit that datasets
currently receive does not correspond to their actual usage[@datarank].
One of the issues is that there is no standard for citing datasets, and
even if they are cited, they are not properly tracked by major
scientific indices. Interestingly, while datasets are still used and
mentioned in articles, we lack methods to extract such mentions and
properly reconstruct dataset citations. The Rich Context Competition
challenge aims at closing this gap by inviting scientists to produce
automated dataset mention and linkage detection algorithms. In this
article, we detail our proposal to solve the dataset mention step. Our
approach attempts to provide a first approximation to better give credit
and keep track of datasets and their usage.

The problem of dataset extraction has been explored before.
@ghavimiIdentifyingImprovingDataset2016 and
@ghavimiSemiautomaticApproachDetecting2017 use a relatively simple
tf-idf representation with cosine similarity for matching dataset
identification in social science articles. Their method consists of four
major steps: preparing a curated dictionary of typical mention phrases,
detecting dataset references, and ranking matching datasets based on
cosine similarity of tf-idf representations. This approach achieved a
relatively high performance, with $F_{1}=0.84$ for mention detection and
$F_{1}=0.83$, for matching. @singhalDataExtractMining2013 proposed a
method using normalized Google distance to screen whether a term is in a
dataset. However, this method relies on external services and is not
computational efficient. They achieve a good $F_{1}=0.85$ using Google
search and $F_{1}=0.75$ using Bing. A somewhat similar project was
proposed by @luDatasetSearchEngine2012. They built a dataset search
engine by solving the two challenges: identification of the dataset and
association to a URL. They build a dataset of 1000 documents with their
URLs, containing 8922 words or abbreviations representing datasets. They
also build a web-based interface. This shows the importance of dataset
mention extraction and how several groups have tried to tackle the
problem.

In this article, we describe a method for extracting dataset mentions
based on a deep recurrent neural network. In particular, we used a
Bidirectional Long short-term Memory (BiLSTM) sequence to sequence model
paired with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) inference mechanism. The
architecture is similar to chapter 6, but we only focus on the detection
of dataset mentions. We tested our model on a novel dataset produced for
the Rich Context Competition challenge. We achieve a relatively good
performance of $F_{1}=0.885$. We discuss the limitations of our model.

The dataset
===========

The Rich Context Dataset challenge was proposed by the New York
University's Coleridge Initiative [@richtextcompetition]. The challenge
comprised several phases, and participants moved through the phases
depending on their performance. We only analyze data of the first phase.
This phase contained a list of datasets and a labeled corpus of around
5K publications. Each publication was labeled indicating whether a
dataset was mentioned within it and which part of the text mentioned it.
The challenge used the accuracy for measuring the performance of the
competitors and also the quality of the code, documentation, and
efficiency.


We adopt the CoNLL 2003 format [@tjong2003introduction] to annotate
whether a token is a part of dataset mention. Concretely, we use the tag
DS denotes a dataset mention; The B- prefix indicates that the token is
the beginning of a dataset mention, the I- prefix indicates the token is
inside of dataset mention, and O denotes a token that is not a part of
dataset mention. We put each token and its tag (separated by horizontal
tab control character) in one line, and use the end of line (\\n)
control character as separator between sentences (see Table 2.1). The dataset were randomly split by
70%, 15%, 15% for training set, validation set and testing set,
respectively.

  tagging format.

The Proposed Method
===================

Overall view of the architecture
--------------------------------

In this section, we propose a model for detecting mentions based on a
BiLSTM-CRF architecture. At a high level, the model uses a
sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network that produces the
probability of whether a token belongs to a dataset mention. The CRF
layer takes those probabilities and estimates the most likely sequence
based on constrains between label transitions (e.g.,
mention--to--no-mention--to-mention has low probability). While this is
a standard architecture for modeling sequence labeling, the application
to our particular dataset and problem is new.

We now describe in more detail the choices of word representation,
hyper-parameters, and training parameters. A schematic view of the model
is in Figure 3.1 and the components are as follows:

1.  Character encoder layer: treat a token as a sequence of characters
    and encode the characters by using a bidirectional LSTM to get a
    vector representation.

2.  Word embedding layer: mapping each token into fixed sized vector
    representation by using a pre-trained word vector.

3.  BiLSTM layer: make use of Bidirectional LSTM network to capture the
    high level representation of the whole token sequence input.

4.  Dense layer: project the output of the previous layer to a low
    dimensional vector representation of the the distribution of labels.

5.  CRF layer: find the most likely sequence of labels.

Figure 3.1. Network Architecture of BiLSTM-CRF network

Character encoder
-----------------

Similar to the bag of words assumption, a word could be composed of
characters sampled from a bag of characters. Previous research
[@santos2014learning; @jozefowicz2016exploring] has shown that the use
of character-level embedding could benefit multiple NLP-related tasks.
In order to use character-level information, we break down a word into a
sequence of characters, then build a vocabulary of characters. We
initialize the character embedding weights using the vocabulary size of
a pre-defined embedding dimension, then update the weights during the
training process to get the fixed-size character embedding. Next, we
feed a sequence of the character embedding into an encoder (a
bidirectional LSTM network) to produce a vector representation of a
word. By using a character encoder, we can solve the out-of-vocabulary
problem for pre-trained word embedding, as every word could be composed
of characters.

Word Embedding
--------------

The word embedding layer is responsible for storing and retrieving the
vector representation of words. Concretely, the word embedding layer
contains a word embedding matrix $M^{tkn}\in\mathbb{R}^{|V|d}$, where
the $V$ is the vocabulary of the tokens and the $d$ is the size of the
embedding vector. The embedding matrix was initialized by a pre-trained
GloVe vectors [@pennington2014glove], and updated by learning from the
data. In order to retrieve from the embedding matrix, we first convert a
given sentence into a sequence of tokens, then for each token we lookup
the embedding matrix to get its vector representation. Finally, we get a
sequence of vectors as input for the encoder layer.

LSTM
----

The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural
network which takes the output of previous step as input of the current
step recurrently. This recurrent nature allows it to learn from
sequential data, for example, the text which consists of a sequence of
works. RNN could capture contextual information in variable-length
sequences in theory but it suffers from gradient exploding/vanishing
problems [@pascanu2013difficulty]. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
architecture was proposed by @hochreiter1997long to cope with these
gradient problems. Similar to standard RNN, the LSTM network also has a
repeating module called LSTM cell. The cell remembers information over
arbitrary time steps because it allows information to flow along it
without change. The cell state is regulated by a forget gate and an
input gate which control the proportion of information to forget from a
previous time step and to remember for a next time step. Also, there is
a output gate controlling the information to flow out of the cell. The
LSTM could be defined formally by the following equations:

$$i_{t}=\sigma(W_{i}x_{t}+W_{i}h_{t-1}+b_{i})$$

$$f_{t}=\sigma(W_{f}x_{t}+W_{f}h_{t-1}+b_{f})$$

$$g_{t}=tanh(W_{g}x_{t}+W_{g}h_{t-1}+b_{g})$$

$$o_{t}=\sigma(W_{o}x_{t}+W_{o}h_{t-1}+b_{o})$$

$$c_{t}=f_{t}\bigotimes c_{t-1}+i_{t}\bigotimes g_{t}$$

$$h_{t}=o_{t}\bigotimes tanh(c_{t})$$

where $x_{t}$ is the input at time
$t$, $W$ is the weights, $b$ is the bias. The $\sigma$ is the sigmoid
function, $\bigotimes$ denotes the dot product, $c_{t}$ is the LSTM cell
state at time $t$ and $h_{t}$ is hidden state at time $t$. The $i_{t}$,
$f_{t}$, $o_{t}$ and $g_{t}$ are named as input, forget, output and cell
gates respectively.

LSTM can learn from the previous steps, which is the left context if we
feed the sequence from left to right. However, the information in the
right context is also important for some tasks. The bidirectional LSTM
[@graves2013speech] satisfies this information need by using two LSTMs.
Concretely, one LSTM layer was fed by a forward sequence and the other
by a backward sequence. The final hidden states of each LSTM were
concatenated to model the left and right contexts

$$h_{t}=[\overrightarrow{h_{t}}\varoplus\overleftarrow{h_{t}}]$$

Finally, the outcomes of the states are taken by a Conditional Random
Field (CRF) layer that takes into account the transition nature of the
beginning, intermediate, and ends of mentions. For a reference of CRF,
refer to [@lafferty2001conditional]

Results
=======

In this work, we wanted to propose a model for the Rich Context
Competition challenge. We propose a relatively standard architecture
based on a BiLSTM-CRF recurrent neural network. We now describe the
evaluation metrics, hyper-parameter setting, and the results of this
network on the dataset provided by the competition.

For all of our results, we use $F_{1}$ as the measure of performance.
This measure is the harmonic average of the precision and recall and it
is the standard measure used in sequence labeling tasks. This metric
varies from 0 to 1, the higher the better. Our method achieved a
relatively high $F_{1}$ of 0.885 for detecting mentions.

We train models using the training data and monitor the performance
using the validation data (we stop training if the performance does not
improve for the last 10 epochs). We are using the Adam optimizer with
learning rate of 0.001 and batch size equal to 64. The hidden size of
LSTM for character and word embedding is 80 and 300, respectively. For
the regularization methods, and to avoid over-fitting, we use L2
regularization set to 0.01 and we also use dropout rate equal to 0.5. We
trained 8 models with a combination of different GloVe vector size (50,
100, 300 and 300) and dropout rate (0.0, 0.5). The hyper-parameter
settings are present in Table 4.1.

Table 4.2. Performance of proposed network

| Models | GloVe size | Dropout rate | Precision | Recall | F1    |
|--------|------------|--------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| m1     | 50         | 0.0          | 0.884     | 0.873  | 0.878 |
| m2     | 50         | 0.5          | 0.877     | 0.888  | 0.882 |

| m6     | 200        | 0.5          | 0.885     | 0.880  | 0.882 |
| m7     | 300        | 0.0          | 0.868     | 0.886  | 0.877 |
| m8     | 300        | 0.5          | 0.876     | 0.878  | 0.877 |


The test performances are reported in Table 4.2. The best model is trained by
word vector size 100 and dropout rate 0.5 with $F_{1}$ score 0.885
(Table 4.2), and it takes 15 hours 58
minutes for the training on an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU in a computer with
an Intel Xeon E5-1650v4 3.6 GHz CPU with 128 GB of RAM.

We also found some limitations to the dataset. Firstly, we found that
mentions are nested (e.g. HRS, RAND HRS, RAND HRS DATA are linked to the
same dataset). The second issue most of the mentions have ambiguous
relationships to datasets. In particular, only 17,267 (16.99%) mentions
are linked to one dataset, 15,292 (15.04%) mentions are listed to two
datasets, and 12,624 (12.42%) are linked to three datasets. If these
difficulties are not overcome, then the predictions from the linkage
process will be noisy and therefore impossible to tell apart.

Conclusion
==========

In this work, we report a high accuracy model for the problem of
detecting dataset mentions. Because our method is based on a standard
BiLSTM-CRF architecture, we expect that updating our model with recent
developments in neural networks would only benefit our results. We also
provide some evidence of how difficult we believe the linkage step of
the challenge could be if the dataset noise are not lowered.

One of the shortcomings of our approach is that the architecture is
lacking some modern features of RNN networks. In particular, recent work
has shown that attention mechanisms are important especially when the
task requires spatially distant information, such as this one. These
benefits could also translate to better linkage. We are exploring new
architectures using self-attention and multiple-head attention. We hope
to explore these approaches in the near future.

There are number of improvements that we can make in the future. A first
improvement is to use non-recurrent neural architectures such as the
Transformer which has shown to be faster and a more effective learner
compared to recurrent neural networks. Another improvement would be to
bootstrap information from other dataset sources such as open access
full-text articles from PubMed Open Access Subset. This dataset contains
dataset *citations* [@datarank]---in contrast to the most common types
of citations to publications. The location of this citations within the
full-text could be exploited to perform entity recognition. While this
would be a somewhat different problem than the one solved in this
article, it would still be useful for the goal of tracking dataset
usage. In sum, by improving the learning techniques and the dataset size
and quality, we could significantly increase the success of finding
datasets in publications.

Our proposal, however, is surprisingly effective. Because we have barely
modified a general RNN architecture, we expect that our results will
generalize relatively well either to the second phase of the challenge
or even to other disciplines. We would emphasize, however, that the
quality of the dataset has a great deal of room for improvement. Given
how important this task is for the whole of science, we should try to
strive to improve the quality of these datasets so that techniques like
this one can be more broadly applied. The importance of dataset mention
and linkage therefore could be fully appreciated by the community.

# Chapter 12 - The future of context

# The Future of AI in Rich Context

**Paco Nathan**

The setting for Rich Context originated in needs to analyze confidential micro-data for [evidence-based policymaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_for_Evidence-Based_Policymaking_Act).
The nature of that work involves collaboration using [_linked data_](http://linkeddata.org/), with strict requirements for data privacy and security, plus provisions for data stewardship and dataset curation.
Due to the highly regulated environments, that data cannot be examined outside of its specific use cases.
In a world where public search engines crawl and index millions of terabytes, making search results available within milliseconds to anyone with a browser and an Internet connection, the setting for Rich Context may appear utterly alien.
Seemingly, a reasonable compromise would be to run queries of sensistive data within their secure environments, and otherwise leave the process unexamined.

However, there’s a broader scope to consider, far beyond the process of managing research projects or curating particular datasets.
The great challenges of our time are human in nature – climate change, terrorism, overuse of natural resources, the nature of work, and so on – and these require robust social science to understand their causes and consequences.
Effective use of data for social science research depends on understanding how datasets have been produced and how they’ve been used in previous works.
That understanding of data provenance is complicated by the fact that research often must link datasets from different data producers, different agencies, different organizations.

Other factors confound this situation.
On the one hand, the availability of inexpensive computing resources, ubiquitous connected mobile devices, social networks with global reach, etc., implies that researchers can acquire large, rich datasets.
Researchers can also fit statistical models that might have seemed intractably complex merely a decade ago.
On the other hand, accumulating important information about datasets, their provenance, and their usage has historically been a manual process.
Sharing this kind of information across organizations is difficult in general, and when datasets include confidential data about human subjects it becomes impossible to provide open access to the original data.
These issues combine to contribute to a lack of reproducibility and replicability in the study of human behavior, and threaten the legitimacy and utility of social science research.

The problems enumerated above make it difficult for people to understand about data usage, although at the same time they present opportunities for leveraging automation.
Consider how one of the major challenges in social science research is search and discovery: the vast majority of data and research results cannot be easily discovered by other researchers.
From one perspective, researchers are the users of micro data and its related [_metadata_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) – in other words, information about the structure of datasets, their provenance, etc. – and those researchers produce outcomes, often in the form of publications.
Publications accumulate expertise and nuances about datasets, including the data preparation required, research topics and methodology, what kinds of analyses were attempted and ultimately used, which information within the datasets was most valuable for the results obtained, and so on.
These details produced through publications represent _metadata about datasets_.
While the metadata within publications may be relatively unstructured – i.e., not explicitly articulated, nor shared outside of the current project – advances in machine learning provide means to extract metadata from unstructured sources.

The exchange of metadata plays another important role.
From the perspective of a data publisher (i.e., an agency) the many concerns about security and data privacy indicate use of _tiered access_ for sensitive data.
Datasets which do not contain sensitive data may be made freely available to the public as [_open data_](https://www.data.gov/).
Other datasets may require DUAs before researchers can access them.
So the data sharing may need to be organized in tiers.
Nonetheless, metadata for the private tiers in many cases may still be shared even though the data cannot be linked directly without explicit authorizations and stewardship.
So metadata provides a role of exchanging information about sensitive data, in ways that can be accumulated across a broader scope than individual research projects.

The opportunity at hand is to leverage machine learning advances to create feedback loops among the entities involved: researchers, datasets, data publishers, publications, and so on.
A new generation of tooling for search and discovery could leverage that to augment researchers: informing them about what datasets are being used, in which research fields, the tools involved, as well as the methods used and findings from the research.


## The Case for Rich Context

Consider the two most fundamental workflows within Rich Context, where analysts and other researchers interact among data providers, data stewards, training programs, security audits, etc.:

 -  **Collaboration and Workspace:** where researchers collaborate within a secured environment, having obtained authorizations via NDAs (non-disclosure agreements), DUAs (data use authorizations), etc.
 -  **Data Stewardship:** where data stewards can review and determine whether to approve requests for using the datasets that they curate, and then monitor and report on subsequent usage.

These components represent _explicitly_ linked feedback loops among the researchers, projects, datasets, and data stewards.
Researchers also use other _implicitly_ linked feedback loops externally to draw from published social science research.
Overall, the general category of linked data describes these interactions.

A large body of AI applications leverages linked data.
Related R&D efforts have focused mostly on public search engines, e-commerce platforms, and research in life sciences – while in social science research the use of this technology is relatively uncharted territory.
Also, given the security and compliance requirements involved with sensitive data, the process of leveraging linked data in social science research takes on nuanced considerations and compels novel solutions.

This area of focus represents the core of Rich Context: the interconnection of point solutions that facilitate research, as explicit feedback loops, along with means to leverage the implicit feedback loops that draw from published research.
Making use of AI applications to augment social science research is the goal of Rich Context work, and that interconnection of feedback loops, through a graph, creates a kind of _virtuous cycle_ for metadata – analogous to the famous [virtuous cycle of data](https://youtu.be/21EiKfQYZXc) required for AI applications in industry, as described Andrew Ng.

In general, guidance for Rich Context can be drawn from the FAIR[^1] data principles for data management and data stewardship in science.
The FAIR acronym stands for _Findable_, _Accessible_, _Interoperable_, and _Reusable_ data, addressing the issue of reproducibility in scientific research.
One observation from the original FAIR paper describes core tenets of Rich Context:

> Humans, however, are not the only critical stakeholders in the milieu of scientific data. Similar problems are encountered by the applications and computational agents that we task to undertake data retrieval and analysis on our behalf. These ‘computational stakeholders’ are increasingly relevant, and demand as much, or more, attention as their importance grows. One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science, therefore, is to improve knowledge discovery through assisting both humans, and their computational agents, in the discovery of, access to, and integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and other scholarly digital objects.

In other words, throughout the use cases for scientific data there are substantial opportunities for human-in-the-loop AI approaches, where the people involved increasingly have their work augmented by automated means, while the automation involved increasingly gets improved by incorporating human expertise.
One can use the metaphor of a _graph_ to represent the linkages: those that span across distinct research projects, those that require cross-agency collaboration with sensitive data, and those that integrate workflows beyond the scope of specific tools.
Specifically, this work entails the development of a [_knowledge graph_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) to represent metadata about datasets, researchers, projects, agencies, etc., – including the computational agents involved – as distinct entities connected through relations that model their linkage.

![example graph relations](combined_images/illo.2.png "example graph relations")

Much of the intelligence in this kind of system is based on leveraging inference across the graph, insights which could not be inferred within the scope of a single research project or through the use of one particular tool.
Over time, the process accumulates a richer context of relations into that graph while clarifying and leveraging the feedback loops among the entities within the graph.
Rich Context establishes foundations for that work in social science research.

The [Rich Context Competition](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition#problemdescription) held during September 2018 through February 2019 invited AI research teams to compete in one aspect of Rich Context requirements.
Several teams submitted solutions to automate the discovery of research datasets along with associated research methods and fields, as identified in social science research publications.
Methods for machine learning and text analytics used by the four finalist teams provided complementary approaches, all focused on the problem of [_entity linking_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking), with a corpus of social science research papers used as their training data.

The results of the competition provided metadata to describe links among datasets used in social science research. In other words, the outcome of the competition generated the basis for a moderately-sized knowledge graph.
There are many publication sources to analyze, and the project will pursue that work as an ongoing process to extract the implied metadata.
Meanwhile the increasing adoption and usage of the ADRF framework continues to accumulate metadata directly.


## Use Cases for Rich Context

Looking at potential use cases for Rich Context more formally, we can identify needs for leveraging a knowledge graph about research datasets and related entities.
For each of these needs, we can associate solutions based on open source software which have well-known use cases in industry.

As an example, consider a dataset _A001_ published by a data provider _XYZ Agency_ where _Jane Smith_ works as the data steward responsible for curating that dataset.
Over time, multiple research projects describe the use of _A001_ in their published results.
Some researchers note, on the one hand, that particular columns in data tables within _A001_ have some troubling data quality issues – inconsistent names and acronyms, identifiers that require transformations before they can be used to join with other datasets, and so on.
On the other hand, the body of research related to _A001_ illustrates how it gets joined frequently with another dataset _B023_ to support analysis using a particular research method.
The two datasets provide more benefits when used together.

While access to the _A001_ dataset gets managed through the _XYZ Agency_ and its use of the ADRF framework, other datasets such as _B023_ get used outside of that context.
A knowledge graph is used to accumulate information about the datasets, research projects, the resulting published papers, etc., and applications for augmenting research derive quite directly from that graph.
For example, feedback from researchers about how _A001_ gets combined with other datasets outside of the _XYZ Agency_ domain help guide _Jane Smith_ to resolve some of the data quality issues.
New columns get added with cleaner data for identifiers, which allows more effective linking.
Other feedback based on machine learning models that have classified published papers then helps recommend research methods and candidate datasets to new analysts – and also to agencies that have adjacent needs, but did not previously have visibility into the datasets published by _XYZ Agency_.

These are the kinds of applications that become enabled through Rich Context.
Search and discovery is clearly a need, although other use cases can help improve the discovery process and enhance social science research.
The following sections discuss specific use cases and their high-level requirements for the associated technologies.


### Search and Discovery

As described above, the vast majority of social science data and research results cannot be easily discovered by other researchers.
While public search engines based on keyword search have been popularized by e-commerce platforms such as Google and Bing, the more general problem of search and discovery can be understood best as a graph problem, and the needs in social science research are more formally understood as recommendations across a graph.

For example, starting with a given dataset, who else has worked with that data?
Which topics did they research?
Which methods did they use?
What were their results?
In other words, starting from one entity in a knowledge graph, what other neighboring entities are linked?

These kinds of capabilities may be implemented simply by users traversing directly through the links of the graph.
However, at scale, that volume of information can become tedious and overwhelming.
It’s generally more effective for user experience (UX) to have machine learning models summarize, then predict a set of the most likely paths through the graph from a particular starting point.

One good approach for this is the general case of _link prediction_[^2]: given a researcher starting with a particular dataset and goals for topics or methods, represent that as a local, smaller graph.
Then use link prediction to fill-in missing entities and relations, extending the local graph for that researcher.
In other words, what other datasets should be joined, how can particular fields be used, what research topics or methods are related, which published papers might become foundations for this work?
The most likely links inferred become top recommendations.
Also, this kind of recommendation is not limited to the start of projects, it can be leveraged at almost any stage of research.

### Entity Linking

The Rich Context Competition demonstrated how entities and relations used to construct a knowledge graph can be mined from a corpus of scientific papers.
Machine learning methods for _entity linking_[^3] used in the competition need to be generalized and extended, then used to analyze the ongoing stream of published social science research.
This work provides potential benefits for the publishers, for example helping them analyze and annotate newly published papers, developing dashboards about data impact metrics for journals or authors, and so on.

An additional benefit of entity linking is to help correct abbreviations, localized acronyms, or mistakes in linked data references.
This is an iterative process which will need integration and feedback with data stewardship workflows.


### Classifiers

As any researcher or librarian knows well, curating a large set of research papers by hand is labor-intensive and prone to errors.
Machine learning models based on _supervised learning_ or _semi-supervised learning_ (human-in-the-loop) can produce classifiers that annotate research papers automatically.

At some point, the ADRF framework may run classifiers on the workflows (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) for projects in progress.
By extension, classifiers may infer across the knowledge graph to add annotations for datasets as well.
This work can be considered a subset of link prediction, also related to entity linking.

### Transitive Inference

The metadata collected through the use of the ADRF framework or extracted from research publications includes relations that link entities in the graph.
Once a graph is constructed, additional relations may be inferred.
This is a case of [_transitive inference_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation), which can help add useful annotations to the graph, as shown in the following diagram:

![transitive relations](combined_images/illo.3.png "transitive relations")

In an example from Norse mythology, Torunn is the daughter of Thor, and Thor is the son of Gaea, therefore Torun is the _granddaughter_ of Gaea.
The same process can apply, for example, to relations that describe links between datasets and researchers.

Note that embeddings have proven to be a powerful approach for inference about patterns, based on deep learning.
On the current forefront of AI research, methods that leverage _reinforcement learning_[^4] are positioned to outperform embeddings soon, since they explore/exploit the graph structure instead of relying on a history of observed patterns.
This is especially useful for _knowledge graph completion_, where there are cases of incomplete metadata in the knowledge graph, which is essential for Rich Context work.

### Iterative Improvement of the Knowledge Graph

Most of the finalist teams in the Rich Context Competition made use of other existing graphs to bootstrap their machine learning development work, such as the [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/reference-data-schema), [Semantic Scholar](http://api.semanticscholar.org/corpus/), and others purpose-built for the competition.
Those teams cited how some graph would need to be extended in the future, to improve recognition accuracy.

Rich Context now subsumes that effort, making the iterative improvement of the knowledge graph an ongoing priority.
In lieu of those other graphs used for bootstrap purposes during the competition, the Rich Context knowledge graph provides the foundation for machine learning.

This process of accreting more entities into the graph and refining their relations leads to better training data and improved machine learning models.
Over time, as our models improve, the previously analyzed research papers can be re-evaluated to extract richer results.
That work in turn enhances social science research within the ADRF framework, along with data curation.
That overall dynamic represents the virtuous cycle of metadata, which continually improves Rich Context.

### Axioms for Dataset Curation

Another immediate use of Rich Context is to assist the data stewards to understand the broader scope of usage for the datasets that they curate.
For example, ontology _axioms_ used on the metadata in the graph can help analyze:

 - consistency checks for the incoming metadata
 - which data stewardship rules apply in a given case

In a way, that helps codify what would otherwise be “institutional lore” – instead that's now captured for others to study, use for training new staff, etc.

Note that the ADRF framework must provide means for customizing and configuring these kinds of axioms, so that data stewardship rules rules are not tightly coupled with the security audits and release cycle.
Those rules can change rapidly, depending on new legislation or other policy updates, or even due to different agency environments.


## Leveraging Open Standards and Open Source

Overall, the Rich Context portion of the ARDF framework represents a _data catalog_ along with associated _data governance_ practices.
As a first step in knowledge graph work, we can make use of existing open standards for metadata about data catalogs and datasets.
For example, the [W3C Data Activity](https://www.w3.org/2013/data/) coordinates a wide range of metadata standards, including:

- [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) – metadata about data catalogs
- [VoID](https://www.w3.org/TR/void/#dataset) – metadata about datasets
- [DCMI](http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) – Dublin Core metadata terms
- [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-skos-core-guide/) – “simple knowledge organization system”

These represent [controlled vocabularies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary) described in [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) and based atop [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).
These standards can be combined and extended to suit the needs of specific use cases, such as within the ADRF framework.
In particular, the Rich Context knowledge graph is a superset of a [_DCAT-compliant data catalog_](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#conformance).
Taken together, localized extensions of these open standards represent an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) – essentially as a specification for defining metadata that can be added into the knowledge graph and how that graph should be structured.
Development of that ontology along with example metadata plus Python code to validate the graph is managed in the public repository [adrf-onto](https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/adrf-onto/wiki) on GitHub.

The workflows within the ADRF framework represent use cases of data governance, and there is substantial overlap between Rich Context and emerging trends for data governance in industry.
There are open source projects which leverage knowledge graphs to collect metadata about datasets and their usage, where machine learning helps address the complexities[^5] of data governance in industry data science work.
For instance:

- [Amundsen](https://eng.lyft.com/amundsen-lyfts-data-discovery-metadata-engine-62d27254fbb9) from Lyft
- [Marquez](https://marquezproject.github.io/marquez/) from WeWork
- [WhereHows](https://github.com/linkedin/WhereHows) from LinkedIn
- [Databook](https://eng.uber.com/databook/) from Uber (pending release as open source)

Of course the Rich Context work addresses special considerations for sensitive data and compliance requirements.
Even so, much can be learned from these related open source projects in industry, which are pursuing similar kinds of use cases.
[TopQuadrant](https://www.topquadrant.com/) and [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/) are examples of commercial vendors which construct knowledge graphs about datasets, also for data governance purposes – respectively in the Finance and Pharma business verticals.
These commercial solutions similarly make use of DCAT, VoID, DMCI, SKOS, and also the FAIR data principles.

In general, the subject of metadata exchange for data governance use cases is addressed by the [ODPi](https://www.odpi.org/) open standard [Egeria](https://www.odpi.org/projects/egeria) and related work by Mandy Chessell[^6], et al., including the [Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org/) open source project.
Much of that work focuses on standards used to validate the exchange of metadata reliably across different frameworks.
This implies potential opportunities for Rich Context to interoperate with other data governance solutions or related metadata services.

To help establish open standards and open source implementations related to Rich Context, the ADRF team has collaborated with [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).
A new Rich Context feature set is being added to [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is one of the key open source projects used in the architecture of the ADRF framework, and these new features will be integrated into its future releases.
The new Rich Context features support projects as top-level entities, real-time collaboration and commenting, data registry, metadata handling, annotations, and usage tracking – as described in the Project Jupyter “press release” requests for comments: [data explorer](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-data-explorer/blob/master/press_release.md), [metadata explorer](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-metadata-service/blob/master/press_release.md), and [commenting](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-commenting/blob/master/press_release.md).
For example, a team of social science researchers working on a project could use the commenting feature in Jupyter to make an annotation about data quality issues encountered in a particular dataset.
That comment, as metadata about the dataset, would get imported into the knowledge graph, and could later be used for recommendations to a data steward or other researchers.

Note that most of the machine learning approaches referenced above are specific cases of [_deep learning_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), based on layered structures of artificial neural networks. In particular, _graph embedding_[^7] is an approach that vectorizes portions of graphs to use as training data for deep learning models.
Graph embedding can be used to perform entity linking, link prediction, etc.
In many of these cases, the resulting machine learning models become proxies for the graph data, such that the entire knowledge graph data is not required in production use cases.
That practice contrasts earlier and generally less effective approaches which relied on graph queries applied to the full data.
Note that the [winning team](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/an-interview-with-the-allen-institute-for-artificial-intelligence) in the Rich Context Competition was from [Allen AI](https://allenai.org/) which is a leader in the field of using embedded models for natural language.
Typical open source frameworks which are popular for deep learning research include [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (from Facebook) and the more recent [Ray](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributed_training.html) (from UC Berkeley RISElab).


## System Architecture Overview

The following diagram illustrates a proposed system architecture for Rich Context as an additional module in the ADRF framework:

![Rich Context module](combined_images/illo.4.png "Rich Context module")

Building on the DFCore features plus the Data Stewardship module, Rich Context provides both a destination for metadata (logging events from components, or extracted metadata from analysis of publications) and a source for metadata ontology used in the ADRF framework.
Machine learning models get trained and updated based on the knowledge graph, then used for services (recommender system, classifiers, etc.) provided back into the ADRF framework, and additionally to support training initiatives – or for general purpose search and discovery by researchers.

The additional system components for implementing Rich Context are based primarily on open source software (e.g., PyTorch) and extensions of open standards (e.g., W3C), all within the security context of AWS GovCloud implementation of the ADRF framework.


## Trends, from origins to near-term future projections

Meanwhile, the development of Rich Context has followed a familiar progression, echoing how the history of IT and data analytics practices matured over decades -- albeit at a much faster pace.
That progression indicates likely directions for how AI applications will come into use for Rich Context.
Initial steps for Rich Context allowed researchers to analyze and report about sensistive data, while maintaining security and privacy compliance.
That's roughly analogous to data analytics during the heyday of _enterprise data warehouses_ and _business intelligence_ during the 1990s.
Subsequent work improved online workflows for data stewards, adding reports about usage along with some metadata derived as "exhaust" from logs.
That's roughly analogous to "data driven" organizations that emerged during the late 2000s after initial adoption of _data science_ practices.
Next steps, such as the Rich Context Competition, began to use _machine learning models_ to extract metadata that was embedded in unstructured data (i.e., research publication) to augment research efforts.
That's roughly analogous to the trends of machine learning adoption in industry during the mid 2010s.
In the immediate future, Rich Context applications begin to leverage  inference based on _knowledge graph_ representations about researchers, datasets, publications, data stewards, and so on.
Contemporary work in _deep learning_ promises AI-based applications that can leverage embeddings in the graph, to give social science researchers better recommendations for their work.
While that depends on historical patterns, current research on _reinforcement learning_ to explore/exploit the structure of graphs can move beyond history and patterns, effectively considering "what if" scenarios that suggest unexplored research opportunities.
That echoes the contemporary AI landscape, leading into the 2020s.

## Summary

Rich Context recognizes that social science research depends on _linked data_ usage of micro data and its metadata.
Effective management of that metadata is based on a graph that exists outside the context of component point solutions and specific workflows.
While there is substantial use of linked data for ecommerce platforms and research in life sciences, social science research presents nuances and new challenges that haven’t been addressed previously.

The Rich Context portions of the ADRF framework interconnect workflows that facilitate research – as explicit feedback loops in the graph – along with means to extract metadata from published research – as implicit feedback loops in the graph.
That process creates a kind of virtuous cycle for metadata, making use of AI applications to augment social science research, with continual improvement of the entities and relations represented within the graph.

A prerequisite was to create a corpus of research publications, used for training data during the Rich Context Competition, which demonstrated how to extract metadata from research publications.

The next step will be a formal implementation of the knowledge graph, based primarily on extensions of open standards and use of open source software.
That graph is represented as an extension of a DCAT-compliant data catalog. It will eventually incorporate the new Rich Context features going into Project Jupyter.
Immediate goals are to augment search and discovery in social science research, plus additional use cases that help improve the knowledge graph and augment research through the ADRF framework.

In the longer term, the process introduces human-in-the-loop AI into data curation, ultimately to reward researchers and data stewards whose work contributes additional information into the system.
With this latter step, in the broader sense Rich Context helps establish a community focused on contributing code plus knowledge into the research process.
