<h2>3.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The relationship between research, researchers and data is changing.
Data has always played a critical role in scientific research, however
in recent years it has taken centre stage not only for the so-called
hard sciences, but also for the social sciences, and it has an
increasing role in the humanities (Giuliano, 2019). We assert that this
change is, at least in part, driven by two key factors: First, the
increasing volume of data that is available to researchers either, for
example, through the increasing sensitivity of instruments that aid
experimental work, or through the ubiquity of computer systems with
which we interact in our daily lives. Second, our ability to process and
analyse these data is growing quickly as computers become faster and
algorithms become more powerful. While some researchers welcome having
more data to work with, others are challenged or marginalised in this
new data-rich world (Eijnatten et al., 2013; Grusin, 2014; Leurs and
Shepherd, 2017). These effects are often compounded by the tools that
researchers must master to connect their research to data.</p>
<p>In the hard sciences, the CERN Open Data Portal contains 131 datasets
describing particle collisions, each of which comprise around 300Gb of
data at the time of writing (CERN, 2019). In the social sciences, the
CISER Data Archive at Cornell is home to more than 1000 different social
science data sets (CISER, 2019). These examples are individual instances
chosen at random from many that could be used to demonstrate the variety
and scale of data available for research. However, even these examples
don’t begin to quantify the amount of detailed personal data available
to companies such as Facebook. Data of this latter kind has already been
used in academic studies as well as in more controversial contexts
(Jordan and Weller, 2018; Kamp et al., 2019; Stark, 2018). Clearly,
there is an increasing diversity and depth of data available for
research from both traditional and from new sources.</p>
<p>Many researchers now work with large volumes of data. Fortunately, many
facilitating technologies have become commoditised and are available at
a fraction of their original cost: storage is cheap and data transfer is
fast. But, Increasing the value of data to researchers is no longer
about technology, rather it is about the information and culture around
the data.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we take our lead from Chapter 1 in recognising not only
that science is at a crossroads but that the whole of research is
changing. We discuss two elements of infrastructure that, if enhanced,
can make data more useful and valuable to the whole research community:
information infrastructure and cultural infrastructure. The Rich Context
project supports the development of tools that enrich not only
information infrastructure around datasets, but which also enhance the
cultural infrastructure. <em>Information infrastructure</em> includes details
of the approach to data stewardship, context of usage, code applied to
the dataset in its production, as well as code applied to the data to
derive further results or translate it for practical uses. All these
factors add critical elements to the research infrastructure. <em>Cultural
infrastructure</em> includes creating the incentives, triggers and
frameworks that encourage the dataset stewards, experts and users to
contribute to these critical information elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="information-infrastructure">
<h2>3.2 Information Infrastructure<a class="headerlink" href="#information-infrastructure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Information infrastructure can be defined as the collection of processes
and artefacts that are foundational to today’s scholarly communications.
A simplified model of scholarly communications would have artefacts such
as journals, journal articles, article metadata and citations. In this
case, the processes would be peer review and scholarly search.</p>
<p>When creating one of the first scientific journals <em>Philosophical
Transactions</em> 350 years ago, the members of the Royal Society did not
have today’s data-centric world in mind. While a clear line can be drawn
from the articles of that time to the articles of today, infrastructures
have grown up around research publications in the intervening years that
have moved the structures and expectations of the research article
forward. These norms are powerful and persistent through their ubiquity.
For example, in the large majority of modern research literature, we
continue expect articles to be grouped into journals and published on a
specific date, and we expect there to be a version of record that
constitutes a definitive record of a piece of research.</p>
<p>Data is more fluid than a standard research article: it is produced and
updated more frequently and iteratively; it needs to be shared with many
in a collaborative context; it is processed and versioned by different
colleagues. Data does not fit into the normalised research publication.
Research fields that rely on data are beginning to publish data as a
distinct output from a research article. Data is becoming a principal
research output, while the technological challenges of publishing data
are being addressed, the format and necessary fields of the metadata
that describe data, the file format in which the data resides, the
resource to annotate the data to make it useful to others, the way in
which data should be cited in a paper or by another dataset, the
description of the processing that has been applied to the data, the
details of the ethical review process behind the exercise that gathered
the data, and many other norms do not yet exist homogeneously across
subjects and geographies. There are not yet strongly established norms
that help researchers to have trust in data.</p>
<p>A dataset can change with time for many reasons: data may be added over
time, corrections may be issued, and so on. In these cases, it may be
appropriate to “version” the dataset (by issuing a persistent identifier
for a point-in-time snapshot for the dataset, allowing subsequent
changes to receive their own “versions”). But changes to a dataset may
have a knock-on effect on the interpretation of the data and may
fundamentally alter the research result that was originally reported.
Moreover, in many fields “Big Data” is so central that it not only puts
pressure on the community to establish an acceptable model of data
publication, but also puts significant stress on how we read, interpret,
and review research as a whole.</p>
<p>Many datasets are now so vast that we lack the ability as humans to
consume them in an easy way. Visualisation technologies and other tools
that allow us to interact with and sample data dynamically have received
significant attention in recent years, and have helped with the
interpretation of data in online environments. But it is simply
impossible to reduce some types of data to a single figure or printable
table, as would be the case for “traditional” journal publishing. By
attempting to do so, we miss the essence of the data and risk failing to
communicate data-driven conclusions accurately. This limitation of
current publication formats (e.g. static PDF files for articles) is an
issue that relates to the reproducibility crisis of modern research.</p>
<p>Peer review is another process that is not easy to apply to data as a
“first class” research object. Historically, peer reviewers have ensured
that a piece of research is well-communicated and correct in the sense
that it is reproducible. This level of peer review is difficult to apply
in the context of research data. If data is being published as a primary
output, then it may be possible to perform a kind of peer review by
applying some statistical tests to a sample of the data, or by using
some other appropriate technique. However, it is no longer practical in
most cases to set up a parallel experiment to reproduce data, as had
been the case in years past. Across all contexts there are good reasons
for these challenges: the experiment may be too costly to repeat, or the
conditions of the original data collection may not be replicable (for
example, surveying stress levels of the populace during a specific
political event). In addition, ethical considerations such as the
anonymity of those being surveyed may make certain types of data
difficult to review. Thus, we need to develop robust and accepted
approaches to peer review, not only for data itself but also for those
publications that are heavily based on data. Without peer review or some
suitable proxy for peer review that makes sense for data, it is
difficult to know whether a dataset can be trusted. Without trust, a
dataset has no value to a researcher who seeks to build upon it.</p>
<p>Several publishing innovations have made journal articles more
discoverable and accessible in recent years, such as preprint servers,
the widespread use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), and centralized
search engines. However, while some of these infrastructures do enhance
a researcher’s ability to find research data, they do not fully
translate from the realm of journals to data. There are multiple reasons
for this lack of translation, some of the key features include: a)
weakness of a homogeneous metadata infrastructure for datasets; b)
inhomogeneity in the types of data that can be shared; c) proliferation
of different platforms to store data; d) lack of standardised
publication practices; e) lack of adoption of standards across fields.
When compared with the “shape” of an academic article for which there is
a standard structure (e.g. DOI, abstract, title, authors, keywords, etc)
specifically designed to facilitate human search, it is clear that
datasets are contextualised by an immature information infrastructure.</p>
<p>Datasets are more complex to classify and annotate than articles, yet
some progress is being made. The core fields required to create a valid
DataCite record are identifier, creator, title, publisher, publication
year and resource type (DataCite Metadata Working Group, 2016). All
other data fields are optional (e.g. location, funder, subject,
contributors) due to the fundamental uncertainty in what might
constitute research data in the future. This flexibility limits how data
can be discovered. It has taken some years for Web of Science, Google
and others to introduce functionality to search for datasets in their
discovery systems.</p>
<p>Technological infrastructure for data--or lack thereof--has huge
implications for the discovery, peer review, citation practices,
interpretation, and availability of data. These challenges are
interconnected with challenges we face when thinking about the cultural
infrastructure for data, as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cultural-infrastructure">
<h2>3.3 Cultural Infrastructure<a class="headerlink" href="#cultural-infrastructure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two main aspects to cultural infrastructure: incentives and
capability. Both aspects affect how researchers engage with research
data, and their behaviours relating to sharing it with others and making
it available to external scrutiny.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, academics do not typically take up research careers for
financial gain. Rather, they choose to dedicate themselves to
understanding a specific problem or field partially in the hope of
making a discovery. For most researchers, success is not strongly
coupled to prize winning, but rather by winning the freedom to determine
their own research agenda. Researchers in many fields are promoted by
publishing in specific high-impact journals, leading to funding success,
which in turn usually leads to greater control of your research.</p>
<p>Sharing data is often not well-aligned with the current model of
incentives. Parting with the data that underpins your research gives
rise to two concerns. Firstly, that someone may find an error in your
work and discredit what you have done. Secondly, that someone else may
not share their own data but will gladly reuse yours if you make it
available. This is especially the case in fields where success is based
on having more data to analyse.</p>
<p>A further level of inequity exists in which data-related jobs are valued
by the Academy. If a researcher happens to be particularly talented in
working with data curation, data analysis or data processing, there is
no track for recognising these talents. They are unlikely to be a first
author on a publication in a major journal due to their data wrangling
talents, and hence they have less of a chance of career progression than
researchers who take a more traditional “publish or perish” path with
their work as described above.</p>
<p>This set of perverse incentives means that people with the capability to
handle data are often incentivised to leave research. Hence, not only do
we have a problem of incentives in sharing and communicating data, but
we also have a problem in retaining people who have the capability that
we need to structure data so that it can be shared and built upon.</p>
<p>Capability for sharing data is the second aspect of the cultural
challenge that academia continues to wrestle with. Making data available
to others is generally accepted as a key part of the research
communication process. However, there are certain established norms
around when the data should be shared, and to what depth it is shared
(Linek et al., 2017); for example, in fields where human subjects
research is prevalent, there is a much more conservative attitude
towards open data than in fields like astronomy where data sharing is
widely practiced, given that data can be collected by only a handful of
observatories and telescopes worldwide.</p>
<p>In fields that are more applied, ensuring that data generated as a
result of a commercial relationship is protected is crucial. In such
fields, academics often have a better understanding of copyright,
intellectual property rights and licences (Treadway et al., 2016). But
outside of this context, there is a general lack of understanding of
these issues and hence data are often not shared over concerns for a
perceived legal barrier.</p>
<p>Other concerns are ethical—for example, should these data be shared if
it might infringe the rights of the subjects of the research?
Researchers are beginning to become aware that, through the use of
algorithms, some data is not as well anonymised as it may first appear
(Siddle, 2014). Anonymisation of data is a research field in and of
itself (Li et al., 2007).</p>
<p>The degree and nature of ethical issues and industry-proximity vary
greatly between different research fields and give rise to different
cultures of data usage and re-usage across fields and even within
fields. Some researchers are motivated to engage with the open access
community and hence choose approaches to sharing data that include
granting permissive licences, association of unique identifiers with
data, adherence to data standards and training students to adhere to
similar approaches. Other researchers are motivated to ensure that data
are not shared due to the information that can be inferred by processing
the data.</p>
<p>The power of the newest algorithms, or of algorithms yet to come, mixed
with constantly developing ethical nuance means that it is difficult to
pre-empt what may or may not be acceptable to share in the future.
Hence, some may feel that it is simply better not to share, especially
in the social sciences, where many of these issues are more prone.</p>
<p>Other concerns are simply practical—how does one make data available
in a way that is meaningful to others? The work associated with making a
dataset generically machine-readable is challenging for many
researchers, who are not to be experts in data handling. The work
associated with making a dataset human-understandable, reproducible and
fully contextualised is often significant. Funding constraints may make
it impractical to share data or to add useful, valuable or even critical
annotations to a dataset. However, funders are beginning to prioritise
these activities in their grant programs (Jisc, 2019; NNLM, 2019). All
these factors lead to uncertainty exacerbated by different levels of
confidence and understanding and consequently an uneven landscape in
what is shared, how it is shared and where it is shared.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enriching-context">
<h2>3.4 Enriching context<a class="headerlink" href="#enriching-context" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The points discussed above offer some indication of what would be needed
to improve the value of research data. Firstly, to address issues of
cultural infrastructure, we need to adopt an expanded version CredIT
(Allen et al., 2014) that focuses on datasets. This expansion would
ensure that all contributors to a dataset’s creation, development and
maintenance over time are stored in a machine-readable format. Such a
record is central to the facilitation of culture change across research.
Only with this structure in place can the activities around datasets be
readily recognised and incentives created that would support data
sharing. Secondly, to address the deficits in information
infrastructure, a set of tools that allow research data to be discovered
and contextualised needs to be introduced. In this section, we focus on
this second challenge.</p>
<p>The ability to add context any piece of research was a strong driver for
the creation of Dimensions (Hook et al., 2018). The idea that all
research happens in a particular place, at a particular time, carried
out by a set of people, some of whom may be affiliated with a research
institution, gives a set of metadata that allows us the “weak context”
of a piece of research. By “weak context” we mean that the context being
provided gives no deep understanding of the context of an article to a
non-expert and is essentially indistinguishable from standard metadata.
But with modern data mining approaches, it is possible to add a “strong
context”.</p>
<p>Strong contextualisation of research should provide a user with rich
information about the research including funding, other research
produced as part of the larger project (e.g. related publications,
clinical trials, etc), and details of the research that was built on top
of it. This information should also fit into, trends and graphical
representations that offer a more complete, more rapid understanding of
how research fits into the larger field, related fields, or the context
of the publishing journal or supporting institution. For example, for a
research article, we should be able to quickly understand how many
researchers are in a related field, whether the field is growing, how
old the field is, how much funding has been deployed in the field, which
countries have provided that funding, whether the field has begun the
translation to application through patents or clinical trials, or
whether it has been used as a basis for the formulation of policy.</p>
<p>Context can also be offered in the data that we provide to understand
the reach and influence of research.</p>
<p>Alternative metrics (“altmetrics”) are data from the social web that run
orthogonal to classic citation measures, which can be seen to add
significant context to an article – extending our understanding of how
different cohorts of potential users of the research are engaging with
it. For example, altmetrics can be used to understand if an article is
being mentioned in the news, in which geographical regions it is being
noticed, whether it is being used as part of a teaching syllabus, and
many other kinds of public and non-traditional scholarly engagement.
These data can then be visualized in creative ways to add instant
additional context to engagement with a research article (see Fig. 3.1).</p>
<p><img alt="_images/chap03_image1.png" src="_images/chap03_image1.png" />{width=”7.270833333333333in”
height=”2.5277777777777777in”}</p>
<p><em>Figure 3.1: Different types of context tracked by Altmetric.com for any
research output.(Reproduced by permission of Altmetric.com)</em></p>
<p>How datasets are used in research more broadly is another important
piece of context that data search engines lack that would significantly
enhance discoverability of a dataset and that would consequently
increase the value of the data. This is where the Rich Context project
can add significant value to a broad research community.</p>
<p>Enhanced context for research data and its impacts could be offered to
users in the form of in-app badges and other “signposts” that connect
data with its larger context. Such a contextualizing badge could bring
together existing data, including not only the number of citations that
the dataset has received, but also whether the data has been versioned
(through Figshare’s repository metadata), discussed online (through
Altmetric data), and what kind of tools and insights have been built on
top of the data (through rich mining of full-text and citation data
available in the ReadCube reference management corpus and in
Dimensions).</p>
<p>Correctly developed and accepted by the community, this type of
information can make a contribution to solving many of the problems
highlighted in this article. If the correct contextual facets can be
developed, then recognition would be easier to assign to those who have
contributed to the process of creating and maintaining datasets. With
greater context around them, datasets become easier to locate,
understand and value. This in turn could lead to a broader evaluative
environment and more engagement from academics.</p>
<p>Engagement across academia, however, is not uniform. Mechanisms need to
be provided to engage data science-focused researchers from whom more
details of their tools, scripts and codebooks could be drawn, adding
further value to research data. At the same time, engagement tools need
to allow data scientists to leverage this information so that it is
valuable to them when they are the consumers of search results. These
are subtly different use cases from those of standard researchers. By
mining ever more open research systems wherein data is being analyzed
(e.g. Gigantum, Github, etc), we can start to integrate these other
crucial engagement contexts as well.</p>
<p><img alt="_images/chap03_image2.png" src="_images/chap03_image2.png" />https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3OunhdD8OksXbG5n9dlxQZ4vHfq3ytZuYahLuNwnXG2oaJ7vSpCkCULgc_8tpapwUqzFLsALR6Xcrhl2ZgyYtvxOhg2kfoXeAJ1MoibnK0liPl2w6xhvoMye-lGtyopkM0ja1xnB{width=”4.543310367454068in”

<p><em>Figure 3.2: Mock-up of a research data badge helping to contextualise a
set of search results.</em></p>
<p><img alt="_images/chap03_image3.png" src="_images/chap03_image3.png" />https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/51fefhu7zEe3Y61OD1vbe-Bl9EiBI8IUUj1FOnP7NLLexSqDO7cJrzBeuzmwUR7eC84AQKmcMwDcTKW3trd7-vnNiyelvHvEOdM_Da5OgEoTYh5lvrz8wfxWzTH2_5DJjfgwe9Ed{width=”4.163163823272091in”
height=”4.505208880139983in”}</p>
<p><em>Figure 3.3: Mock-up of a research data badge helping to contextualise a
specific dataset.</em></p>
<p>In Figures 3.2 and 3.3, we have visualised some early concepts for how a
contextualized research data badge could look. This visualisation is
based on insights from the Rich Context project and uses data that could
be mined from articles that use a specific dataset. In particular, we
suggest four facets of context that both data science-focused
researchers and others could find helpful when viewing a dataset:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Experts</strong> <strong>who have made use of the data</strong>, sourced from
references made to the dataset in a professional context such as an
industry whitepaper or policy document</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Academics</strong> that <strong>cite the data</strong>, mined from citation of the
dataset or ancillary data in the peer reviewed literature</p></li>
<li><p><strong>End users of the data</strong>, sourced from code book references
included in public code repositories</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhancements of the data</strong>, vis-à-vis annotations and comments
made on the data in public forums.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, we believe that, if deployed across the many environments in
which researchers discover data, the thinking behind the Rich Context
project can overcome both the cultural and information-based
infrastructure challenges that we highlighted. If these challenges can
be overcome by the methods developed, for example in Chapter 13 of this
volume, then this will significantly extend the use and discoverability
of datasets. The number and variety of datasets in use in academia will
certainly expand in the future, and we can only see data becoming even
more central to contemporary research efforts. As such, it is critical
to invest in robust infrastructures, not only to support the production
and sharing of these data, but also to change the culture and evaluative
environment around research data. It is only through initiatives such as
these that we will be able to solve the vast and complex sociotechnical
challenges that face academia today.</p>
