<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The rich context competition was designed to inspire computer scientists
to automate the discovery of research datasets and the associated
research methods and fields in social science research publications.
Participants were asked to use any combination of machine learning and
data analysis methods to identify the datasets used in a corpus of
social science publications and infer both the scientific methods and
fields used in the analysis and the research fields.</p>
<p>The competition had the potential to draw on existing work. The IARPA
FUSE program had funded research teams to develop automated methods that
would identify technical emergence using information found in published
scientific, technical, and patent literature(<em>1</em>, <em>2</em>), and resulted in
recommendation systems like meta.com(<em>3</em>). Google Dataset Search had
developed search technologies that would find datasets in data
repositories across the Web(<em>4</em>) Academic social network sites like
ResearchGate and Academia.edu had developed platforms whereby
researchers provided feedback about their scientific activities(<em>5</em>) And
there is a well established tradition of competitions in computer
science, particularly natural language processing(<em>6</em>).</p>
<div class="section" id="context">
<h2>Context<a class="headerlink" href="#context" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Social scientists might define rich context as a dataset search and
discovery process: what does the data <strong>measure</strong>, what <strong>research</strong> has
been done by which <strong>researchers</strong>, with what <strong>code</strong>, and with
what <strong>results</strong>. Computer scientists might define rich context as
knowledge graph representation and recommender systems. Others might
define rich context as promoting datasets to be a first class entity.
But the core idea of the competition was to incentivize computer
scientists to build automated tools that find datasets mentioned in
scientific publications and build an associated community of interest.
The results could then be used to recommend datasets to empirical
researchers and encourage researchers to provide feedback about the
value of the recommendations.</p>
<p>The innovation literature provided some guidance. At a high level, most
systematic incentives for innovation can be classified as one of two
types: up-front support for research (“push programs”) or commitments to
reward successful results (“pull incentives”)(<em>7</em>), with a given
incentive evaluated on its balance between positive and negative
outcomes. The patent system of protecting intellectual property for a
period of time, for example, is an incentive that balances the benefit
to the creator of time-limited exclusive use of a patented innovation
with the cost of restriction on broader use(<em>8</em>).</p>
<p>Prizes are another common pull incentive, offering direct reward for an
innovation that arises from competition among innovators. Innovation
prizes offer an immediate benefit that can be a powerful incentive for
development and diffusion of innovations, but the design of the contest
that awards them is important to maximizing innovation benefits, and
effective evaluation is difficult. For prizes to encourage innovations
that are of high quality, desirable, and more production-ready, the
contests that offer them need to be designed carefully to include
additional evaluation requirements or incentives, with the benefits to
participants carefully balanced so that the rewards make the additional
requirements worth their cost(<em>9</em>, <em>10</em>) .</p>
<p>The literature informing the development of a community of practice in a
domain of work where knowledge is cumulative emphasizes the advantages.
Successful communities can develop knowledge-sharing and dissemination
mechanisms, common norms of sharing and cooperation, and broad agreement
on technical paradigms and jargon(<em>11</em>). As open source software
communities show, however, they must be carefully incentivized and
nurtured to grow participation(<em>12</em>) and managed well to maintain
resources and quality of output over time(<em>13</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specific-challenges">
<h2>Specific Challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#specific-challenges" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There were a number of challenges associated with developing a natural
language processing (NLP) competition applied academic publications.
Access to scientific publications is typically limited. In addition,
there are no existing annotated data sets or standards for annotations
and existing solutions are not easily reusable. A similar project
focused on text analysis for clinical studies reported that NLP research
teams do not traditionally collaborate closely, and models and systems
that result tend to not be designed or implemented to be easy to use or
to scale up for production use(<em>14</em>). However, in the NLP domain, Ian
Soboroff at the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST)
has developed a series of competition patterns designed to inspire
disparate groups of researchers to help to carry out information tasks
against text data. These include basic competitions where data is
provided to groups and they are allowed to train and then submit a
number of runs of their models against a subset of evaluation data
(<em>6</em>). More elaborate competitions include ones organized around an
“incident”, where groups are given training data and model
specifications and allowed to train a model, game out an incident where
an event occurs in a previously unseen language and then they have to
quickly adapt their model to the new language and submit results(<em>15</em>).</p>
<p>We also wanted to encourage researchers to develop a generalized model
to identify datasets that was not overly dependent on the use of formal
titles of data sets, because many research datasets do not have such
formal titles. Thus the problem was much more complicated than a named
entity recognition problem, because competitors needed to be able to
characterize the language of discussing and using data to recognize
where data is discussed in a particular article and then identify which
data sets.</p>
<p>This chapter describes the implementation of the competition,
particularly focusing on the lessons learned.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="competition-design">
<h1>Competition Design<a class="headerlink" href="#competition-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The goal of the competition was to use any combination of machine
learning and data analysis methods to identify the datasets mentioned in
a corpus of social science publications and infer both scientific
methods used in the analysis and the publication’s research fields[^1].</p>
<p>The competition had two phases.</p>
<p>In the first phase, participating teams were provided with a listing of
datasets and a labeled corpus of 5,000 publications with an additional
dev fold of 100 publications. Each publication was labeled to indicate
which of the datasets from the master list were referenced within and
what specific text was used to refer to each dataset. The teams used
this data to train and tune algorithms to detect mentions of data in
publication text and, when a data set in our list is mentioned, tie each
mention to the appropriate data set. A separate corpus of 5,000 labeled
publications was held back to serve as an evaluation corpus. Each team
was allowed up to 2 test runs against this evaluation corpus before
final submission. The final models of each group were run against this
holdout corpus and the results were used to evaluate submissions, along
with a random qualitative review of the mentions, methods, and fields
detected by the team’s model. Submissions were primarily scored on the
accuracy of techniques, the quality of documentation and code, the
efficiency of the algorithm, and the quality and novelty of the methods
and research fields inferred for each of the publications.</p>
<p>Four finalist teams were selected to participate in the second phase,
the teams from: Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, United
States; GESIS at the University of Mannheim, Germany; Paderborn
University, Germany; and KAIST in South Korea.</p>
<p>In the second phase, finalists were provided with a new training corpus
of 5000 unlabeled publications and asked to discover which of the
datasets from the first phase’s data catalog were used in each
publication, as well as infer associated research methods and fields. As
in the first phase, teams were scored on the accuracy of their
techniques, the quality of their documentation and code, the efficiency
of their algorithm, and the quality and novelty of the methods and
research fields inferred for each of the publications.</p>
<p>At the end of each phase, competing teams packaged their models into a
docker container using a model packaging framework designed and built
for the competition by NYU, and the containers were installed on AWS
servers and run by the competition organizers against the holdout to
generate predictions that were used to evaluate the teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data">
<h1>Data<a class="headerlink" href="#data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>For training and evaluation data, our goal was to lay the foundations
for developing a “gold standard corpus” (GSC) of academic populations
tagged with the semantic context within which datasets are mentioned
used in analysis. A GSC corpus is one that is manually tagged and
reviewed for quality, usually for a particular domain and task. Creating
one is time-consuming and expensive(<em>16</em>) because it involves selecting
a corpus to annotate, then implementing a manual annotation and review
scheme[^2].</p>
<p>While our goal was not to make a GSC, we used our data creation to begin
to assess data needed for high quality data detection models and to test
potential methods for creating a GSC. To create our competition training
and evaluation data, we started with data set citation data from the
ICPSR data catalog
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/">[https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/]{.underline}</a>),
then used methods that originated in quantitative content analysis of
communication artifacts(<em>17</em>) combined with software designed to reduce
and simplify the work of human coders to increase reliability (<em>18</em>).</p>
<p>In each of the two phases, competing teams were given text and metadata
for 5,000 publications and single set of metadata on 10,348 data sets of
interest, shared between the two phases, for use in training and testing
their models. Separate 5,000-publication samples were provided for each
phase. The corpus of 10,348 data sets included data maintained by
Deutsche Bundesbank and the set of public data sets hosted by the
Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).
In addition, a single 100-publication development fold was provided
separate from the training and testing data to serve as a test for
packaging of each team’s model, and as a quick test of their model and
the quality of its output[^3].</p>
<p>In each phase, an additional separate set of 5,000 publications were
held back and used to evaluate the models. After the 1st phase, the
phase 1 holdout was also provided to phase 2 competitors to serve as
additional training and testing data.</p>
<p>In phase 1, both the train-test publications and the holdout
publications were broken into 2,500 publications each that used one or
more of the data sets of interest for analysis, as compiled by ICPSR and
Bundesbank staff, and 2,500 publications that had not been annotated and
had been filtered to not contain data. The data set citations were
captured in a separate data set citations JSON file. The citations for
the phase 1 train-test publications were provided to competition teams
to use as training data, while the citations in the phase 1 holdout were
used to test the quality of each team’s model in phase 1, and given to
teams as additional training data in phase 2.</p>
<p>In phase 2, teams were provided with the phase 1 holdout for additional
annotated training data, and then provided with an additional
un-annotated set of 5,000 publications to assess their model’s behavior
on un-curated data. The phase 2 holdout of 5,000 publications was also
unannotated, and evaluation of data set detection was based on
hand-coded data set reference data revised to make the data more
representative of what the models were asked to detect.</p>
<div class="section" id="publications">
<h2>Publications<a class="headerlink" href="#publications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All publication text provided to teams was either open access, and so
freely available, or licensed from the publisher for use in the contest
by contest participants. In each phase of the competition, a set of
publications was provided to the participants and a separate set of
publications was held out and kept in reserve so it could be used to
evaluate the teams’ models. For each publication, participants were
provided with PDF and plain text versions of each publication along with
basic metadata (pub_date; unique_identifier - DOI or equivalent;
text_file_name; pdf_file_name; and publication_id - the unique
identifier from our internal system used to manage the data, metadata,
and underlying relationships between publications and data sets for the
competition).</p>
<p>One particular challenge was that copyright and licensing around
research publications limited what publications could be accessed,
licensed, and distributed for the competition, and so our universe of
publications was limited to publications that were either open access,
or published by Sage Publications.</p>
<div class="section" id="publication-dataset-phase-1">
<h3>Publication Dataset - Phase 1<a class="headerlink" href="#publication-dataset-phase-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2500 labeled training publications</p></li>
<li><p>2500 unlabeled/no-dataset training publications</p></li>
<li><p>100 publication development fold</p></li>
<li><p>2500 labeled holdout publications</p></li>
<li><p>2500 unlabeled/no-dataset holdout publications</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In phase 1, 5,000 publications were provided to participants as a
train-test data set, 5,000 publications were held back for evaluation,
and 100 publications were provided as a separate development fold, for
basic model testing and evaluation. The train-test and evaluation
holdout each contained 2,500 publications that cited at least one data
set, and 2,500 publications that had not been cited by ICPSR as using
their data, and had been filtered to not have obvious markers of using
data.</p>
<p>The annotated portion of these two sets of publications were drawn from
a set of publications provided by Bundesbank that referenced their data
and the publications captured in the ICPSR catalog annotated as having
used a particular data set for analysis. These publications were
collected in a database application designed to facilitate a mix of
human and automated content analysis of publications. They were then
filtered into two sets: those that were open access, and so could be
shared publicly, and those that were not open access, but that were
available from our publisher partner (Sage Publications, or “Sage”). Of
the 5,100 total publications with annotated data citations provided to
phase 1 participants, the 2,550 publications in the train-test corpus
(2,500) and development fold (50) were randomly selected from the open
access set, so they could be distributed freely to all participants. The
2,500 in the holdout were randomly selected from the remainder of the
open access set plus those available from Sage. The un-annotated
publications used in phase 1 were all published by Sage - the 2,550
non-annotated publications in the train-test corpus (2,500) and
development fold (50) were open access publications from Sage journals.
The 2,500 un-annotated publications used in the holdout evaluation
corpus were sampled from across Sage Publications’ journal holdings
including non-open access journals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="publication-dataset-phase-2">
<h3>Publication Dataset - Phase 2<a class="headerlink" href="#publication-dataset-phase-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The main publication corpus for phase 2 of the competition was
10,000 unlabeled publications evenly distributed between 6 key topic
areas (Education, Health care, Agriculture, Finance, Criminal
justice, and Welfare), nicknamed the “wild corpus”.</p></li>
<li><p>5,000 of these 10,000 were given to teams to work with in phase 2
(randomly selected from within each of the 6 key topic areas to
maintain even distribution across topic areas).</p></li>
<li><p>The other 5,000 publications were held out to serve as an evaluation
corpus.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, teams were given the same 100 publication development
fold as in phase 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Teams were given the 5,000 publication evaluation corpus from phase
1 to serve as further train-test data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In phase 2, we worked with Sage to find publications in six key topic
areas of interest for partners and future projects (Education, Health
care, Agriculture, Finance, Criminal justice, and Welfare). For 28,769
matches, Sage provided PDFs for each and we parsed the text (see details
below), removing any that did not parse, or that resulted in file sizes
smaller than 20KB, reducing the size of the sample to 25,888. We looked
at publication year and type to see if we needed to filter out older
publications or non-academic publications, but there were few enough of
each class (644 pre-2000 publications and 3,115 non-research articles)
that we decided we’d keep all in to preserve as much potential for
heterogeneity as possible. From these 25,888 publications, we then
randomly selected a total of 10,000 with the goal to keep the
distribution across the 6 topic areas equal (so 1666 randomly selected
in 2 topic areas, 1667 randomly selected in the other 4). Then, we split
the phase 2 corpus to give half to participants and keep half back for
evaluation, maintaining equal distribution between the topic areas
within each set of 5,000 publications.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="converting-pdf-files-to-plain-text">
<h3>Converting PDF files to plain text<a class="headerlink" href="#converting-pdf-files-to-plain-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The plain text provided for each publication was derived from that
publication’s PDF file by the competition organizers. It was not
intended to be a gold standard, but to serve as an option in case a team
preferred not to allocate resources to PDF parsing.</p>
<p>The articles were converted from PDF to text using the open source
“pdftotext” application, an Xpdf text extraction system. The basic
conversion used the “raw” mode of “pdftotext”:</p>
<p>pdftotext -raw &lt;path_to_pdf.pdf&gt; &lt;path_to_txt.txt&gt;</p>
<p>There are many approaches and tools available for this task. The
rationale behind this simplified process for converting pdfs to texts:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>To render the most usable txt files from available pdfs without over
engineering for any specific types of pdf files (e.g., single column
vs. multi-column).</p></li>
<li><p>To have a process that is easily reproducible across different
machines for free. That is, not all PDFs convert the same way. Some
are more error prone than others. More advanced OCR techniques might
have been able to compensate where Xpdf might have fallen short, but
relying on more sophisticated and perhaps costly text conversion
processes would have made the conversion pipeline more expensive to
reproduce and less portable across different applications.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Because of the basic approach, there were some limitations to note:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Many artifacts from PDF formatting were left behind in the text.</p></li>
<li><p>We had to tweak our processing to get multi-column layouts to output
text in order in a linear, single-column text output, and the method
we ended up using to achieve this precluded more nuanced processing
of other elements of the PDFs.</p></li>
<li><p>Example: tables and charts were not converted in any way to text.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Competition participants were encouraged to try their own conversion
process if this text did not meet their needs. If participant teams
chose to use another means for converting PDF files to plain text, we
asked that they supply us with documentation for installing and running
their conversion process so we could start to build up a set of PDF
processing strategies that could be reused in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finding-data-sets">
<h2>Finding Data Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-data-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Competitors were provided with two sets of data related to detecting
data sets: 1) a catalog of all of the data sets of interest that models
were tasked with finding in publications, including basic metadata for
all and a list of verbatim mention text snippets for those that were
cited in the train-test data; and 2) a subset of these data sets that
were actually specifically annotated as having been used for analysis in
a given publication.</p>
<p>The data set catalog, provided to participants in the JSON file
data_sets.json, contained metadata for all public datasets in the ICPSR
data repository and a subset of public data sets available from Deutsche
Bundesbank. It includes all data sets sited in the train-test and
evaluation corpora, plus many others not cited in either. The data was
provided in JSON format for ease of use, a JSON list of JSON objects,
each of which contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>subjects - list of terms associated with the dataset, based on the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/thesaurus/subject">[ICPSR subject
thesaurus.]{.underline}</a></p></li>
<li><p>additional_keywords - System keyword for where dataset originated.</p></li>
<li><p>citation - Preferred dataset citation.</p></li>
<li><p>data_set_id - Integer ID for dataset from our internal data store
of publications, data sets, and relations. This is the identifier
used in the data_set_citations.json file to identify relationships
between datasets and publications.</p></li>
<li><p>title - Canonical title for dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>name - Canonical title for dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>description - Dataset description, if available.</p></li>
<li><p>unique_identifier - Original unique identifier for dataset,
normally a DOI if available.</p></li>
<li><p>methodology - Methodology for dataset, if available.</p></li>
<li><p>date - Date when dataset was published, if available.</p></li>
<li><p>coverages - Geographic coverages, if available.</p></li>
<li><p>family_identifier - Internal system ID, roughly captures datasets
that have multiple years but are the same dataset. Inconsistently
applied, should not be used in analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>mention_list - Array of strings for annotated mentions as
identified by human reviewers. Not an exhaustive list of mentions
for any given dataset, and only populated for those data sets cited
in the phase 1 train-test corpus.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The mention list is the superset of all unique mention strings
associated with each data set across all of that data set’s citations
where mention data was created. Mention data was only created for data
sets cited in the phase 1 train-test corpus.</p>
<p>ICPSR captured when a given data set was used in analysis within a
particular publication, but it did not capture particulars on how that
determination was made. To provide better data for participants, we
implemented a human content analysis protocol to capture mention text
for each data set-publication pair included in our train-test corpus
(see <a class="reference external" href="#_23ckvvd">[Data Set Mention Annotation Process]{.underline}</a>
below). Since we manually created this data, given limited time and
resources, we initially only did this work for data sets that the teams
would be using for training and testing in phase 1. In future work, we
intend to provide this kind of information for all data sets of
interest, and to refine the protocol to capture the exact position in
the text of each mention along with the verbatim text.</p>
<p>Citations of data sets by publications within our phase 1 corpora were
captured in separate data_set_citations.json files for each of the
train-test and evaluation corpora. Each of these JSON files contains a
JSON list of JSON objects, each of which specifics a single relationship
between a data set and a publication. This JSON format is also used by
models to output detected citations. Each citation contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>citation_id - A unique ID for the relationship between one dataset
and one publication</p></li>
<li><p>publication_id - Unique ID for a publication which is the same ID
for the publication in publications.json</p></li>
<li><p>data_set_id - Unique ID for a dataset which is the same ID for the
dataset in the data_sets.json file.</p></li>
<li><p>mention_list - Optional array of strings for alternative references
for the dataset in the specific publication (only present in
citations included in train-test corpus, and even then, could still
be empty).</p></li>
<li><p>score - Confidence score for the dataset being found in the related
publication. In ICPSR-specified citations, the score will be 1.0. In
model-created files, will depend on the model.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even citations from the phase 1 train-test corpus could have an empty
mentions list. A given publication could, for example, have been tagged
with a dataset by the curator (either at Bundesbank or ICPSR) based on
knowledge of the publication and dataset, but a human coder without this
knowledge was not subsequently able to find specific mentions within the
publication, or the human coder could simply have missed the references.
An empty mentions list is not a guarantee that the data set in question
was not mentioned.</p>
<p>The list of data sets cited in a particular publication is also not
exhaustive. There is the possibility that other data sets from our
catalog of data sets of interest were used in analysis within a paper
but not captured. The ICPSR data did not include mentions where data was
not used in analysis, even of other ICPSR data sets. And named data sets
not within our catalog of data sets of interest could also have been
used in analysis within a given publication.</p>
<div class="section" id="data-set-mention-annotation-process">
<h3>Data Set Mention Annotation Process<a class="headerlink" href="#data-set-mention-annotation-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ICPSR data contains many explicit ties between publications and data
sets that would have been hard to come by otherwise, but the lack of any
indication of which parts of the publication indicated the citation
relationship made it difficult to identify the linguistic context within
the publication that captured the relationship.</p>
<p>To make it easier for participants in the competition to efficiently and
systematically engage with the language used to discuss data, we
developed a content analysis protocol and accompanying web-based coding
application so human coders could examine all of the data set citations
in our train-test corpus and capture mention text for each. This
required human workers to examine each data set citation in the context
of its publication (there were X citations in 2500 training
publications) to identify and mark locations in the text where each data
set was referenced.</p>
<p>Because of the manual effort required, we only did this for the 2,500
train-test publications that referenced data provided to the teams. We
did not manually annotate mention text in the 2,500 publications in the
phase 1 holdout, and this made that data a little less useful for teams
when it was given to them in phase 2.</p>
<p>Our team of coders was spread across the United States, and so we used a
web-based application with a central database store to allow our
distributed team of coders to work in parallel. The basic unit of work
was a publication-data set pair (so a given publication would be
examined as many times as it had different data sets cited within it).</p>
<p>The ICPSR data set repository is very fine-grained in definition of a
data set, so each year of an ongoing survey, for example, might have its
own data set. To save time, we eventually created the concept of a data
set family for these types of data sets and assigned coding for any one
instance in a family to all other instances from that family within a
given publication. So, for example, multiple years of the same survey or
longitudinal data collection were related to each other in a family, and
then coding for one year within a paper was used for all other years
cited in that paper.</p>
<p>The general process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>each user was assigned a list of citations to code.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the user logged in to the coding tool, they were presented with
a list of the coding tasks assigned to them that included a status
of each, so they could track which they had already completed, and a
link for each to the coding page.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the user loads a particular citation for coding, they are
presented with the following coding page, and are asked to follow
the coding instructions in the codebook/documentation for the
annotation tool

</div></blockquote>
<p>Coders were instructed to find terms that relate to mentions of the
dataset and avoid general synonyms of those terms (for example, tagging
“[ANS survey]{.underline}” instead of only “[survey]{.underline}”). If
the phrase provides additional information about collection of the
dataset, the mention is tagged twice. For example, in the case of “[ANS
survey collected/conducted by X]{.underline}”, “[ANS
survey]{.underline}” is captured first, and then “[ANS survey
collected/conducted by X]{.underline}”. At the same time, we tried to
avoid including too much descriptive information of the dataset - the
task is just to code the specific mentions of a particular dataset,
including alternate names (e.g. abbreviations, etc.), rather than trying
to capture full text in which the data set is discussed.</p>
<p>For more details, including an FAQ that provides guidance on specific
issues that arose during coding (like how to deal with data sets that
span multiple years), see the content analysis protocol:

<p>In total, a team of 5 coders, with a background in text analytics for
policy research and computational linguistics, completed the task (Emily
Wiegand, Neil Miller and Jenna Chapman from Chapin Hall at the
University of Chicago, Mengxuan Zhao, Marcos Ynoa and Ekaterina
Levitskaya from the CUNY Graduate Center, Computational Linguistics
program). The results were then used to re-render data_sets.json and
the data_set_citations.json file for the phase 1 train-test data to
include mentions.</p>
<p>This combined protocol and tool were developed in-house. Considerations
behind building in-house:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>From previous work, we had an open-source tool that did what we
would need with minor tweaks, so were able to leverage substantial
existing work, though we did have to pay for the work to customize
it as well as the AWS t2.large instance on which we hosted it.</p></li>
<li><p>This tool includes templates for human-coding application pages like
the one we used, but it is also designed to be used to build up data
about publications from multiple sources and this data is
straightforward to query and interact with. This allowed us to use
the underlying database and application code as the competition
dataset database, not just a place to handle mention coding.</p></li>
<li><p>We looked at off-the-shelf text annotators and Qualitative Analysis
tool such as lighttag.io, tag.works, NVivo, Atlas.ti, MAXQDA.
Unfortunately, given a tight timeline and relatively complex
requirements, we didn’t have the time to come up to speed with any
of these tools. In addition, we needed the tool to be usable by a
distributed team, and that precluded some tools above that did not
support distributed workflows.</p></li>
<li><p>For future coding work, we would love to be able to outsource coding
tool development, and so are looking at distributed coding
applications like lighttag.io and tag.works.</p></li>

<h2>Methods and Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#methods-and-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the task of detecting methods and fields for a given publication,
our goals were broader than simply providing a vocabulary for each and
asking the teams to classify publications against them. We want to
encourage development of models that not only can determine when a given
publication is a part of an existing field or uses an existing method,
but that also understands enough about fields and methods such that they
can be used to detect new fields and methods as they emerge, and can
then be used to look back through time for traces of these new fields
and methods to track their growth and evolution.</p>
<p>To support this goal, we did not give any formal set of either methods
or fields that participants needed to train models to classify from.
Instead, we provided examples of taxonomies of methods and fields that
Sage Publications uses to classify their publications<a class="reference external" href="https://sagepub.libguides.com/research-methods">^4</a>, and we
directed participants to use them as an example, but to try to make
models that would be more creative and potentially able to find new,
emerging, or novel fields rather than just fit a publication to a term
from a predefined taxonomy.</p>
<p>In practice, this decision to forego any kind of fitting to an existing
taxonomy showed the complexity of the problem of understanding fields
and methods well enough to detect them based on linguistic context,
rather than classifying to an existing vocabulary. Some teams limited
themselves to the vocabularies we defined, and the results were
uninspiring. Some teams tried to detect based on text, but ended up with
a lot of noise and few relevant terms.</p>
<p>In addition, we also learned that there is complexity in “methods” that
lumping all methods together did not account for: methods could mean
many things, and we started to find sub-categories that we wish we had
broken this into: statistical methods, analysis methods, data collection
and creation methods, etc.</p>
<p>For future work, for each of these types of information, we intend to
first work to decide what exactly we mean by “fields” and “methods”,
then find or develop one or more taxonomies to precisely capture what we
mean. Once we have these taxonomies, we’ll focus separately on building
models to classify publications to them, and making models to extend and
update them.</p>

<h1>Submission Process<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The primary goals of the submission process developed for our
competition were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>to balance the effort needed for a particular group of participants
to package their model for submission with the effort needed from
the competition organizers to configure, run, and troubleshoot
submissions once they were received.</p></li>
<li><p>to begin development of a model packaging strategy that could be
used to distribute and allow reuse of any model that uses it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, we had the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create submission infrastructure to make it as straightforward and
easy as possible for a team to package their model for submission,
including minimizing the understanding needed to use technologies
chosen for packaging and deployment and having a built-in way to
automatically run the model over the dev fold to validate processing
of standard input formats and creation of required output formats.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize the installation and configuration work needed on part of
competition organizers to replicate computing environments as part
of model submission process.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximize our ability to see and be able to test how each submission
environment is set up, and so avoid accepting a blackbox that could
contain anything (including malicious code or sneaky/clever tricks).</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="building-and-submitting-a-model">
<h2>Building and Submitting a Model<a class="headerlink" href="#building-and-submitting-a-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our approach for participants building and submitting a model combines
Box.com, docker, a git repo for code to implement and support
infrastructure, and shell scripts. The central workspace for competition
participants was a Box folder that contained example docker files, a
copy of the dev fold, and shell scripts that implemented the basic steps
of packaging, building, running, and testing a model. The git repository
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition">[https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition]{.underline}</a>)
was integral to our framework, but was not used directly by
participants. Its code repository was solely used as a home for the
code, scripts, and files that made up our submission framework. We did,
however, host documentation for participants in the repository’s main
README and its wiki
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition/wiki">[https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition/wiki]{.underline}</a>).</p>
<p>To get started, participants downloaded a compressed archive of the Box
folder and extracted it onto a system with a bash shell. Windows systems
were supported, but we recommended that participants with Windows
machines work inside a linux virtual machine.</p>
<p>This work folder contained:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the script “rcc.sh” and its accompanying configuration “config.sh”,
that implements all of the basic actions needed to manage docker for
a model.</p></li>
<li><p>A set of scaffold files and folders that demonstrate how to hook a
model into a docker container, including a Dockerfile with examples
of installing OS packages and python packges in a docker container
and an example “project” folder with a “code.sh” shell script that
is called by default when the docker container is run,
pre-configured to call a provided example python file named
“project.py”.</p></li>
<li><p>A copy of the git repo, for use by the scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>A copy of the dev fold, in the standard data folder structure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The set of scaffold files provided out of the box could be used along
with “rcc.sh” to create a simple docker container to test one’s local
install of docker (including reading from and writing to a data folder
configure in “config.sh”, running a script in the work folder, and
creating output).</p>
<p>Participants were then instructed to work within the “project” folder in
their work folder, get their code working first on their local machine,
then set up a docker container using the provided example files and get
the model running there, to isolate problems with docker from problems
with their model.</p>
<p>When participants were ready to submit, they were asked to compress
their work folder and upload it to the root of their group’s project
folder and send an email to the organizers.</p>
<p>Participants were allowed 2 test submissions before the final
submission, and most groups took us up on those test submissions in
phases 1 and 2. All groups were able to work within the “code.sh” and
“project.py” files in “project” to get their model to run, so no further
customizations were needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model-api">
<h2>Model API<a class="headerlink" href="#model-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our submission framework used a file-system based API for giving the
model input and accepting output. We interaction through the file system
to keep the configuration and implementation simple.</p>
<p>Each time the docker container for a model is run, it is configured to
work in a particular data folder.</p>
<p>This data folder has a standard directory structure:</p>
<p>data|  _input|   |  _files|   |  _text|   |  _pdf|_output</p>
<p>All input information is stored in the “data/input” folder. All output
is expected to be stored in the “data/output” folder.The input folder
will contain a “publications.json” file, with the same contents as
described above in the “Data → Publications” section of this chapter,
that lists the articles to be processed in the current run of the model.
Publication plain text is stored in “data/input/files/text”, one text
file to a publication, with a given publication’s text named
“&lt;publication_id&gt;.txt”. The original PDF files are stored in
“data/input/files/pdf”, one PDF file to a publication, with a given
publication’s text named “&lt;publication_id&gt;.pdf”.</p>
<p>The output folder starts out empty, and is where the model is expected
to place 4 output files after each run of the model:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>data_set_citations.json</strong> - A JSON file that contains
publication-dataset pairs for each detected mention of any of the
data sets provided in the contest data_sets.json file. The JSON
file should contain a JSON list of objects, where each object
represents a single publication-dataset pair.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>data_set_mentions.json</strong> - A JSON file that should contain a
list of JSON objects, where each object contains a single
publication-mention pair for every data set mention detected within
each publication, regardless of whether a gvien data set is one of
the data sets provided in the contest data set file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>methods.json</strong> - A JSON file that should contain a list of JSON
objects, where each object captures publication-method pairs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>research_fields.json</strong> - A JSON file that should contain a list
of JSON objects, where each object captures publication-research
field pairs.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-a-submitted-model">
<h2>Running a Submitted Model<a class="headerlink" href="#running-a-submitted-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once a model was submitted, the competition organizers followed a
standard script for running the model and processing its output for
analysis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For each submission, an AWS instance was spun up from a standard
image pre-configured to run models built using our submission
framework.</p></li>
<li><p>The evaluator connected to the instance and started a screen
session, so work would not be disrupted if connection to server was
lost.</p></li>
<li><p>The model was downloaded to the server and extracted.</p></li>
<li><p>The submission container was built on the server using the provided
Dockerfile and “rcc.sh”, and then the container was run over the dev
fold to test basic functionality of the container and the model, and
to give an estimate of time needed to complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the dev fold was successfully processed, “config.sh” was
reconfigured to point at the evaluation corpus, and the model was
run over the evaluation corpus.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the model completed, standard evaluation Jupyter notebooks in
the git submission framework repository were configured to the
current projects output and run to generate materials for judges to
evaluate the submission.</p></li>
<li><p>Output and results were copied to a central storage area, and the
instance used to run the model was terminated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this process, the evaluator communicated any problems with
the participant team and worked with the team to address problems and
turn around a new version of the model as quickly as possible. If a
team’s model performed poorly on the standard size machine, we also
would sometimes try different sizes of server to give them an idea of
whether their problem was related to needing more compute power, or was
a limitation of their approach independent of available resources.</p>

<div class="section" id="notes-on-the-submission-process">
<h2>Notes on the Submission Process<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-on-the-submission-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We chose Box.com because we have unlimited space there through NYU, and
so we were able to accommodate not only whatever data participants
needed to provide to make their models work, but also all of the data we
provided to participants for training and testing. To minimize
confusion, we pre-configured and shared each team’s Box folder with
them, so they did not have to do any setup.</p>
<p>To setup the infrastructure in each folder, we created a git repository
(https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rich-context-competition) that
contained all of the files, shell scripts, and templates needed to: 1)
configure a new instance of a team folder, for use by competition staff
setting up team folders; 2) develop, package and test deployment of a
model (participants); and 3) support building, running, and evaluating
the models once they were submitted.</p>
<p>We considered using github to store participant submissions, but chose
Box because of its unlimited storage.</p>
<p>We considered using an external service like CodaLab or Kaggle, but an
initial assessment of each suggested that they would not meet our needs
without substantial changes to the design of our competition:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Codalab looked promising, but its documentation was sparse and our
time frame was short enough that we weren’t comfortable we could get
up to speed with it quickly enough to make a reliable, easy-to-use
competition with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Kaggle seemed designed for more basic competition designs (our
evaluation steps were fuzzy, so couldn’t just take their outputs and
make scores - this is not entirely a knock on them - it would be
great to get our tasks to the point where they fit in this
framework, we just don’t have the data yet), and there were also
licensing complications we weren’t comfortable sorting out. We also
needed control over manual evaluation and were concerned there that
their submission and evaluation system wouldn’t support the bespoke
nature of our submissions.</p></li>
<li><p>For both, we also simply weren’t comfortable that we’d be able to
get up to speed on the platform in time to make the experience of
participating in the competition as pleasant and painless as
possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We also wanted to have the flexibility to run many models in parallel
and give models substantial resources if needed, to see how they
performed with different magnitudes of computing resources and to allow
us to try to throw raw compute power at a model if it was running too
slowly, to get it to complete so we could give as good of feedback as
possible. We not only wanted groups to be able to do preliminary
submissions, but we wanted to make sure we could give as much feedback
as possible. This led us toward a container-based approach where we did
what we could to abstract and simplify the running of models, and
allowed for flexibility and configurability in the instances that we
spun up to run the models.</p>

<div class="section" id="evaluation">
<h1>Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In both phases of the competition, we evaluated raw mentions, research
fields, and research methods separate from citation of named data sets.</p>
<div class="section" id="phase-1-evaluation">
<h2>Phase 1 Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#phase-1-evaluation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="mentions-methods-and-fields">
<h3>Mentions, Methods and Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#mentions-methods-and-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In phase 1, expert social science judges evaluated mentions, methods,
and fields in two ways: 1) we randomly selected 10 publications to
manually examine each team’s output against, and made notes of good and
bad for each team, then ranked the teams within each publication; and 2)
we generated distributions of all values found across all publications
within each type of value, counted the occurrences of each, compared the
distributions across teams, and ranked the teams based on how their
distributions compared. To create overall rankings, the judges met,
compared notes and individual rankings, and then agreed on an overall
ranking of the teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-set-citations">
<h3>Data Set Citations<a class="headerlink" href="#data-set-citations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To evaluate data set citations in phase 1, we used the ICPSR citation
data as our evaluation baseline for creating a confusion matrix based on
how each team’s citation findings compared to ICPSR’s baseline, and we
calculated precision, recall, and F1 scores from the confusion matrix to
compare across teams. To create the confusion matrix for each team, we
started with a list of all of the data set-publication pairs found
either in ICPSR’s baseline or the team’s output. We created found-or-not
(1 or 0) vectors for every publication-data set pair for the baseline,
and for the team. Then, for each data set-publication pair, we compared
the values between the baseline vector and the team vector to decide how
to update the confusion matrix for that pair: if a team agreed with
ICPSR on presence of a data set, that was counted as a true positive
(TP). If the team found a data set that ICPSR did not, that was counted
as a false positive (FP). If a team missed a data set ICPSR indicated
was present, it was counted as a false negative (FN). We did not develop
a way to capture true negatives since the metrics we used to evaluate
did not require it. In addition, as part of the processing to create the
overall confusion matrix, we created per-publication confusion matrices
for each publication, so we could track average false positives and
false negatives per publication, and highlight publications that were
higher than the average, for more detailed evaluation.</p>
<p>We also deferred figuring out “mentioned” vs. “used in analysis” in our
initial competition, to make the initial task more manageable. This
decision, combined with the traits of the ICPSR data, caused substantial
noise in the phase 1 precision/recall/F1 scores. For example, even
models that figured out that a longitudinal data set was present
sometimes got many false positives and false negatives because they got
the years wrong, and models that correctly found ICPSR data sets used in
discussion had those counted as false positives because ICPSR had only
captured data sets used in analysis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="phase-2-evaluation">
<h2>Phase 2 Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#phase-2-evaluation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In evaluating phase 2, we kept the division between mentions, fields,
and methods and citations, but we refined our evaluation methods in
based on what we’d learned in the first phase.</p>
<p>Mentions, Methods and Fields</p>
<p>For mentions, methods, and fields in phase 2, we kept the basic strategy
of: 1) comparing the values created by each team’s model in the context
of a set of selected publications and 2) reviewing the overall
distributions of values for each team.</p>
<p>We expanded the number of publications across which we compared values
to make the sample reviewed more representative, though, and created a
web-based tool to help judges deal with the added work from more
publications to review. We also selected publications differently for
data mentions from fields and methods, choosing publications with
different levels of agreement between the teams on whether data was
present or not, to start to evaluate the different model’s ability to
detect data at all, in addition to comparing the results when they
thought a publication contained data.</p>
<p>For fields and methods (and data set citations), we selected 20
publications for each of our 6 topic areas of interest (Education,
Health care, Agriculture, Finance, Criminal justice, and Welfare) with a
few extras (2 extra in finance and 1 extra in criminal justice), for a
total of 123 publications to compare values across. Within the 20
publications per topic area, we worked through a random selection of
articles picking publications to add to our sample to fill out a rough
ratio within each topic area of 5:4:1 between publications with titled
data sets (5); data described, but not titled (4); and no data (1).</p>
<p>To make it easier for the judges to work through this increased number
of publications, we also created a tool that collected the output for
each team side-by-side per publication along with a link to each
publication’s PDF, and had a place for the judge to score each team’s
output for a given publication from among “-1”, “0”, and “1”. Once
judges scored all output, we then created rankings based on the sum of
each team’s scores.</p>

<p><em>Figure 2: The interface given to judges to evaluate data set mentions,
research fields, and research methods.</em></p>
<p>For manual evaluation of data set mentions, we used the same tool
described above, but we chose a different sample of 60 publications
based on agreement between the output of the different participant team
models as to whether publications had data mentions. To generate this
sample, we first loaded all of the output from each team’s model into
our work database. We then made a list of all of the publications in our
phase 2 holdout and, for each publication, the count of teams that had
data set mentions for that publication. We then sampled to get 60
publications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>10 publications where all teams agreed there was no data.</p></li>
<li><p>10 publications where all teams agreed there was data.</p></li>
<li><p>40 publications where the teams disagreed on whether there was data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the 40 publications with disagreement, we selected publications with
1 team, 2 teams, and 3 teams agreeing data was present proportional to
the distribution of each level of agreement in the broader sample:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>17 from 1 (1439/5000 = 0.2878; 0.2878 * 60 = 17.268)</p></li>
<li><p>20 from 2 (1741/5000 = 0.3482; 0.3482 * 60 = 20.892)</p></li>
<li><p>13 from 3 (1080/5000 = 0.216; 0.216 * 60 = 12.96)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We then asked a separate pair of qualitative judges to use the tool to
compare and evaluate the data set mentions generated by the teams across
these publications.</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Data Set Citations<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our analysis of data set citations in phase 2 required a more
substantial rethinking since we did not have any starting point for
presence or absence of data like the ICPSR corpus. We implemented a
method of creating a confusion matrix that could be used to generate
precison, recall, and F1 scores more closely aligned with the task we’d
assigned the teams to implement - finding mentions of data and data sets
within publications.</p>
<p>To implement this, we started with the sample of 123 publications used
for evaluating mentions and fields above and:</p>

<h4>Capturing Data References<a class="headerlink" href="#capturing-data-references" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To capture data references in our sample of publications, we created a
basic protocol for an initial round of data creation
(<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFPEtT4hd93kcsOEzocyB6-a4Hu8WcemKTld-98Q25k/edit#heading=h.f3u3kdbg87s4">[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFPEtT4hd93kcsOEzocyB6-a4Hu8WcemKTld-98Q25k/edit#heading=h.f3u3kdbg87s4]{.underline}</a>),
then evaluated the results throughout the rest of the process. We used a
single data reference coder to encourage consistency in output. Our data
reference coder worked within a spreadsheet to, for each publication in
our sample:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Flag all paragraphs where data was mentioned.</p></li>
<li><p>Cluster mentions together that refer to a single dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>Give each cluster of mentions a row in the spreadsheet. These are
our “data references”.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, for each data reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collect all mentions that refer to the reference.</p></li>
<li><p>decide if the data set is simply cited (“cited”), or if it is
one used in analysis (“analysis”) in the publication</p></li>
<li><p>Capture words or phrases that are key to identification as “key
terms”.</p></li>
<li><p>Also capture any broader contextual text in “Context”, so it
could be used to better understand the nature of the “data
reference”.</p></li>
<li><p>If data set title is present, capture it.</p></li>
<li><p>Try looking up the data set in the database, and if it is there,
store its data set ID.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We tried to capture detailed context on each reference for a couple
reasons: 1) To make it easier for reviewers of this data to evaluate the
quality of each data reference; 2) To give more context for judges
deciding if mentions and citations for a given team were “related” to a
given data reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finding-related-mentions-and-citations">
<h4>Finding Related Mentions and Citations<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-related-mentions-and-citations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>After the data references were captured, a team of coders then looked at
each data reference related to the selected publications for each team
to see if data set citations and mentions by the team were “related” to
the data reference.</p>
<p>The coders, subject matter experts in the different key topic areas,
looked at each “data reference” in publications in their area of
expertise. For each, they evaluated it against the mentions and
citations output by the model of each team that found mentions or
citations in the selected publication. For each reference-team pair, the
coder flagged any mentions or citations they deemed “related to” the
current data reference.</p>
<p>In our protocol
(<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hi13N6gfiRz9nfwCoUQrey8v_ozY7fKHMtHV4GgX2ys/edit">[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hi13N6gfiRz9nfwCoUQrey8v_ozY7fKHMtHV4GgX2ys/edit#]{.underline}</a>),
we describe the coding task as “When you are judging data mentions, we
want to mark mentions on the right as “exists” if they are related to
the data referenced on the left, and make sure to not mark any mentions
as “exists” that are not related.”, balanced with “If in doubt, don’t
mark a given mention as related.”</p>
<p>The definition of “related to” is purposely fuzzy. Our goal was to give
credit for finding language related to a dataset even if it wasn’t a
perfect, formal reference, but to also make sure to not mark things that
are obviously unrelated. To help to flesh this distinction out, we gave
examples and analogies and training, and we had coders work through a
few data references on their own then discuss their decisions.</p>
<p>An example from the protocol: “Think of it as a fuzzy match - we want to
give the models the benefit of the doubt if they get close, especially
if they detect some but not all key terms or phrases or find a mention
of the basic type of data a named data set represents (“wage data” for
IDES Unemployment Wage Records, for example), but we also want to make
sure to reject things that are obviously not related.”</p>
<p>Coders used a web-based coding tool that listed out their assigned
coding tasks and pulled together all of the information so they just had
to scan the page, open the associated PDF if they had questions, and
then mark related items and Submit to save their coding:</p>
<p><img alt="_images/chap05_figure3.png" src="_images/chap05_figure3.png" />{width=”6.5in” height=”5.013888888888889in”}</p>
<p><em>Figure 3: The interface given to judges to evaluate whether a given
team’s data set mentions and citations were related to a given data
reference.</em></p>
<p>As one would expect, while we got coders on the same page, each had
subtly different ideas about what was or was not “related to”. To remove
some of this variability from our final data, we then had a sole
experienced researcher who understood what we were trying to do review
all coding and, when he saw coding that obviously did not fit his
understanding, either: revise to fit his understanding of “related to”;
or flag as one he was unsure of and note his thoughts.</p>
<p>This experienced researcher also served as a final reviewer of the data
references that were collected, marking any that did not actually refer
to data as needing to be removed from our final analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, the protocol designer reviewed all removed data references,
corrections, and ambiguities flagged for additional review, and made a
final set of corrections.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scoring-the-results">
<h4>Scoring the Results<a class="headerlink" href="#scoring-the-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To create a “related to” confusion matrix for each team, we started with
a list of all of the data references that our final reviewers indicated
should be included in our analysis (165 total). We created found-or-not
(1 or 0) vectors with a value for every reference set to 1 for the
baseline, and then set based on our coding for each team. For each
publication, we also included a false positive item that was always 0
for the baseline, and that was set to 1 for a given team if they had any
mentions or citations that were not “related to” a data reference from
that publication.</p>
<p>To build a given team’s vector, for each data references, we checked to
see if any of the team’s mentions or citations had been marked as
“related to” that reference. If one or more of the team’s mentions or
citations was marked as “related to”, we gave that reference a “1” for
that team. If not, we gave it a “0”. Then, for each publication’s false
positive item, if the team had 1 or more mentions and/or citations that
were not “related to” any data reference, the team got a “1” for that
entry. If not, they got a “0”.</p>
<p>To build out a confusion matrix, we went reference by reference: If the
team found mentions and/or citations related to the reference, that was
counted as a true positive (TP). If a team did not have any mentions or
citations related to a given data reference, it was counted as a false
negative (FN). Then, for the publication, if the team had 1 or more
mentions and/or citations that were not “related to” any data reference,
this was counted as a false positive (FP).</p>
<p>We did not develop a way to capture true negatives since the metrics we
used to evaluate did not require it.</p>

<div class="section" id="discussion">
<h1>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Given the time and resources available to put the competition together,
the competition’s design was effective, but required some iteration
within each of the phases. We modified and updated both training data
and model submission infrastructure in response to participant feedback,
and the participants were generally quite positive about the experience.</p>
<p>The docker-based model submission process worked well for the
competition, but subsequent use of the models by Digital Science and
Bundesbank has revealed a need to more precisely design how the models
work within their docker container and the APIs they provide so packaged
models implement a more re-usable API. For example, to be readily able
to be used within an existing environment, the model needs to be able to
be invoked from a simple unit of code (a python function, for example),
rather than needing to spin up an instance of a container each time you
want results.</p>
<p>To facilitate re-use, we need much more detailed specification of how
the participants should implement their models. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If a submission is implementing multiple tasks, each should be
broken into its own separate API so it can be used separately (so
separate services for mention detection, field detection, and data
detection).</p></li>
<li><p>We need to better specify how we expect the models to be re-trained,
in particular elements of the model we expect to be easily changed
and which we expect would require a full retraining to tune. For
example, we hoped to be able to easily switch out the data sets of
interest that are detected specifically without needing to retrain
on a full corpus referring to those data sets, but we didn’t mention
this, and none of the models worked this way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of community building, we inspired participation and the
workshop and discussions after the competition lead to collaborations
between pairs of sponsors and participants and collective work on making
a gold standard corpus that could be used to develop better models in
the future (a great step toward higher quality models), but we need to
continue to work to nurture and grow this community.</p>
<p>The data for the competition was a great start, but trying to use it to
detect data mentions and then start to get at whether data was simply
discussed or actually used in analysis revealed how much work remains to
make high quality training data. The base ICPSR data did not include
mention text where we did not create it, and so for the majority of data
sets, the only text available for characterizing a data set was the
title and a paragraph of description, no examples of how the data would
be discussed within a publication. It also did not capture non-ICPSR
data sets, nor did it include data sets mentioned but not used in
analysis. We need to be able to work with imperfect data, but the
complexity of this task makes it a good fit for better training data. We
also found that our definition of a data set was too specific – ICPSR
is granular down to the year of some of their formal data collections.
Data signatures of interest in the real world might just be clusters of
key terms without a formal title, and our data and models need to
account for this.</p>
<p>Our evaluation approaches were effective given the time we had, but they
also had significant limitations. In phase 1, the ICPSR data was great
for a model that finds named data sets used in analysis, but it was not
as good a fit for evaluating models trying to detect data citations in
general. For example, some high quality models were scored with many
false positives that, on review, were actually correct, but for
non-ICPSR data sets.</p>
<p>In phase 2, our design and evaluation data creation attempted to account
for the limitations of phase 1 - to move from just looking at titled
ICPSR and Bundesbank data sets used for analysis and begin to look at
all the ways data is discussed in academic papers, and how much of that
discussion the combined mentions and citations of each team was aware
of. Its effectiveness depended on how well we designed and carried out
each of these three steps.</p>
<p>We are comfortable with the quality of the resulting data, but it should
be noted that given the time and resources available to us, we had to
make a choice between quality of data and reproducibility. In a perfect
world, content analysis is the discipline of reliably being able to use
a well-designed protocol to create content of comparable quality
regardless of who does the coding. Given this project’s relatively tight
timelines and limited resources, in this process we prioritized quality
of data over reproducibility. We created relatively detailed coding
protocols for each step of the process and we designed review and
refinement into our processes, but we did not have time to go through
multiple rounds of training and evaluation to make each of the protocols
reliable and reusable. At the end, we introduced consistency by having
experienced researchers familiar with our goals review all the output
and either correct problems or flag items that should not be used in
analysis. We believe that this created a reasonable level of consistency
and quality in our output, but intend to refine these protocols for use
in the future,</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h1>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Given the time and resources available, we consider the competition
design to have been effective. The design attracted letters of intent
from 20 teams from 8 countries and 12 teams actually submitted code. The
models were interesting and some of the solutions were novel and
surprisingly effective given their novelty. A nascent community of
practice was also formed. Discussions after the competition led to
collaborations between participants and collective work on making a gold
standard corpus that could be used to develop better models in the
future – an important step toward higher quality models. The models
also ended up being re-usable as they are, though in a limited scope,
and at least one sponsor has been able to run them and get useful
output.</p>
<p>Additional work is continuing in three directions. The first is
developing better corpora: that is discussed in the Appendix to this
chapter by Alex Wade and Sebastian Kohlmeier. The second is developing a
community of practice: a recent workshop
(<a class="reference external" href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextworkshop">https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextworkshop</a>) took the next
step to doing so. The third is to further develop the machine learning
and natural language processing tools through broader based competition:
this is discussed in more detail in the concluding chapter in this book.</p>

<h1>Appendix - Standardized Metadata, Full Text and Training/Evaluation for Extraction Models<a class="headerlink" href="#appendix-standardized-metadata-full-text-and-training-evaluation-for-extraction-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Key challenges when working on an NLP task like dataset mention
extraction that requires access to scholarly literature include the
proliferation of metadata sources and sourcing of full text content. For
example, each metadata source has their own approach for disambiguation
(e.g. recognizing that A. Smith and Anna Smith are the same author) or
de-duplication of content (clustering pre-prints and final versions into
a single record). As a result competition organizers and NLP researchers
currently use ad-hoc processes to identify metadata and full text
sources for their specific tasks which results in inconsistencies and a
lack of versioning of input data across competitions and projects.</p>
<p>One way these challenges can be addressed is by using a trustworthy
metadata source like <a class="reference external" href="http://api.semanticscholar.org/corpus/">[Semantic Scholar’s open
corpus]{.underline}</a> developed
by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) or
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/reference-data-schema">[Microsoft’s Academic
Graph]{.underline}</a>
that make it easy to access standardized metadata from an openly
accessible source. In addition, both Semantic Scholar and the Microsoft
Academic Graph provide topics associated with papers which makes it easy
to narrow down papers by domain. If full text is needed we recommend
tying the metadata to a source of open access full text content like
<a class="reference external" href="https://unpaywall.org/data-format">[Unpaywall]{.underline}</a> to ensure
that the full text can be freely redistributed and leveraged for model
development.</p>
<p>To gather the data we recommend collecting a sufficiently large set of
full text papers (3,000-5,000 minimum) with their associated metadata
and providing participants with a standardized format of the full text.
More data might be required if data is split across many scientific
domains. For example for a task like dataset extraction, reference
formatting is often inconsistent across domains and dataset mentions can
potentially be found in different sections (e.g. background, methods,
discussion, conclusion or the reference list) throughout the text. Once
a decision has been made on the full text to include, the PDF content
can be easily converted into text in a standardized format using a PDF
to text parser like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/allenai/spv2">[AI2’s
ScienceParse]{.underline}</a> (which
handles key tasks like metadata, section heading and references
extraction).</p>
<p>Once the metadata and full text dataset has been created it can be
easily versioned and used again in future competitions. For example, if
updated metadata is needed it’s easy to go back to the original metadata
source (for example by using Semantic Scholar’s
<a class="reference external" href="http://api.semanticscholar.org/">[API]{.underline}</a>) to get the latest
metadata.</p>
<p><strong>[Annotation Protocols to Produce Training &amp; Evaluation
Data]{.underline}</strong></p>
<p>A common approach to machine learning known as <strong>supervised learning</strong>
uses labelled, or annotated, data to train a model what to look for. If
labelled data is not readily available, human annotators are frequently
used to label, or code, a corpus of representative document samples as
input into such a model. Different labelling tasks may require different
levels of subject domain knowledge or expertise. For example, coding a
document for different parts of speech (POS) will require a different
level of knowledge than coding a document for mentions of upregulation
of genes. The simpler the labelling task, the easier it will be for the
coders to complete the task, and the more likely the annotations will be
consistent across multiple coders. For example, a task to identify a
<em>mention of a dataset</em> in a document might be far easier than the task
of identifying only the<em>mentions of</em> <em>datasets that were used in the
analysis phase of research</em>.</p>
<p>In order to scale the work of labelling, it is usually desirable to
distribute the work amongst many people. Generic crowdsourcing platforms
such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk can be used in some labelling
exercises, as can more tailored services from companies such as TagWorks
and Figure-Eight. Whether the labelling is done by one person or
thousands, the consistency and quality of the annotations needs to be
considered. We would like to build up a sufficiently large collection of
these annotations and we want to ensure that they are of a high quality.
How much data needs to be annotated depends on the task, but in general,
the more labelled data that can be generated the more robust the model
will be.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we recommend 3000-5000 papers, but this begs the
question of how diverse the subject domains are within this corpus. If
the papers are all within from the finance sector, then a resulting
model might do well in identifying datasets in finance, but less well in
the biomedical domain since the model was not trained on biomedical
papers. Conversely, if our 3000-5000 papers are evenly distributed
across all domains, our model might be more generically applicable, but
might do less well over all since it did not contain enough individual
domain-specific examples.As a result, we recommend labelling 3000-5000 papers within a domain,
but we plan to do so in a consistent manner across domains so that the
annotations can be aggregated together. In this manner, as papers in new
domains are annotated, our models can be re-trained to expand into new
domains. In order to achieve this, we intend to publish an open
annotation protocol and output format that can be used by the community
to create additional labelled datasets.</p>
<p>Another factor in deciding the quantity is the fact that the annotations
will be used for two discrete purposes. The first is to <em>train</em> a
machine learning model. This data will inform the model what dataset
mentions look like, from which it will extract a set of features that
the model will use and attempt to replicate. The second use of the
annotations is to <em>evaluate</em> the model. How well a model performs
against some content that it has never seen before. In order to achieve
this, labelled data are typically split randomly into training and
evaluation subsets.</p>
<p>One way to evaluate how well your model performs is to measure the
<strong>recall</strong> and <strong>precision</strong> of the model’s output, and in order to do
this we can compare the output to the labelled evaluation subset. In
other words, how well does our model perform against the human
annotations that it was not trained on and has never seen. Recall is the
percentage of right answers the model returned. For example, if the
evaluation dataset contained 1000 mentions of a dataset, and the trained
model returned 800 of them, then the recall value would be .80. But what
if the model returned everything as a dataset, then it would get all
1000, plus a whole bunch of wrong answers. Obviously, the precision of
the model is important too. Precision is the percentage of answers
returned that were right. So, continuing the example above, if the model
returned 888 answers, and 800 of those were right, then the precision of
the model would be ~.90. But again, if the model returned only one
right answer and no wrong ones, the precision would be perfect. So, it
is important to measure both precision and recall. In summary, the model
in this example, got 80% of the right answers, and 90% of the answers it
returned were right. The two measures of recall and precision can be
combined into an F1 score of   ~.847.If we then make modifications to our model, we can re-run it against the
evaluation dataset and see how our F1 score changes. If the score goes
up, then our new model performed better against this evaluation data. If
we want to compare several different models to see which one performed
best, we can calculate an F1 score for each of them. The one with the
highest F1 score has performed the best. Consequently, the quality of
the annotations are critical for two reasons: first, the accuracy of a
<em>model</em> will only be as good as the data upon which it was trained. And
secondly, the accuracy of the <em>evaluation</em> (in this case the F1 score)
can be affected by the quality of the data it is evaluated against.</p>
