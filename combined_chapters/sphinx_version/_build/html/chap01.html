<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Science is at a crossroads. The enormous growth of access to data
coupled with rapid technological progress, has created opportunities to
conduct empirical research at a scale that would have been almost
unimaginable a generation or two ago. Researchers can now rapidly
acquire and develop massive, rich datasets; routinely fit complex
statistical models; and conduct their science in increasingly
fine-grained ways. Yet there is no automated way to search for and
discover what datasets are used in empirical research, leading to
fundamental irreproducibility of empirical science and threatening its
legitimacy and utility(<em>1</em>, <em>2</em>). There is an enormous interest to
change the current manual and ad-hoc system, and incentives are
increasingly aligned: while only a fraction of datasets are identified
in scientific research, those publications that do cite data are cited
up to 25% more than those that do not(<em>3</em>).</p>
<p>Vannevar Bush foreshadowed the issue more than 60 years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased
evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization
extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions
of thousands of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time
to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. … Mendel’s concept
of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because
his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and
extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being
repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in
the mass of the inconsequential”(<em>11</em>).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We can do better – and we now have the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>The core problem that needs to be addressed is automating the search for
and discovery of datasets used in empirical data – building an
Amazon.com for data. The vast majority of scientific data and outputs
cannot be easily discovered by other researchers even when nominally
deposited in the public domain. Faced with a never-ending stream of new
findings and datasets generated using different code and analytical
techniques, researchers cannot readily determine who has worked in an
area before, what methods were used, what was produced, and where those
products can be found. Resolving such uncertainties consumes an enormous
amount of time and energy for many social scientists. A new generation
of automated search tools could help researchers discover how data are
being used, in what research fields, with what methods, with what code
and with what findings —often by passively capitalizing on the
accumulated labor of one’s extended research community. And automation
can be used to reward researchers who validate the results and
contribute additional information about use, fields, methods, code, and
findings.(<em>8</em>)</p>
<p>New advances in technology—and particularly, in automation—can now
change the way in which social science, and hence other sciences, is
done. The place to start is with the social sciences. The great
challenges of our time are human in nature - terrorism, climate change,
the use of natural resources, and the nature of work - and require
robust science to understand the sources and consequences. The lack of
reproducibility and replicability evident in many fields(<em>1</em>, <em>4</em>–<em>7</em>)
is even more acute in the study of human behavior both because of the
difficulty of sharing confidential data and because of the lack of
scientific infrastructure. Social scientists have eagerly adopted new
technologies in virtually every area of social science research—from
literature searches to data storage to statistical analysis to
dissemination of results(<em>8</em>). And, in the United States, the recent
passage of the Foundations of Evidence-based Policymaking Act(<em>9</em>, <em>10</em>)
and the focus on a Federal Data Strategy, mean that there is an
important use case for showcasing the value of new approaches.</p>
<p>The knowing how it has been produced and used before: the required
elements what do the data <em><strong>measure</strong></em>, what <em><strong>research</strong></em> has been
done by what <em><strong>researchers,</strong></em> with what <em><strong>code</strong></em>, and with what
<em><strong>results</strong></em>. Acquiring that knowledge has historically been manual and
inadequate. The challenge is particularly acute in the case of
confidential data on human subjects, since it is impossible to provide
fully open access to the source files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-this-book-came-to-be">
<h1>How this book came to be<a class="headerlink" href="#how-this-book-came-to-be" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This book was born out of a need to solve a very concrete problem. In
2016, the US Congress passed the Commission on Evidence-based
Policymaking Act to make a set of recommendations on how to better use
data for decision-making. The US Census Bureau was charged with
supporting the deliberations of the Commission and asked our team at New
York University to build a secure access facility in which data from
multiple agencies could be securely hosted.</p>
<p>After we built the facility, and had dozens of users, we realized that
putting data in one place, while necessary, was not sufficient for good
analytical work to be done. Every user who accessed the data wanted to
know what other work had been done with the data, with what assumptions
and what results. We were able to provide them with some information,
but essentially the information was drawn from our own research
experience and was certainly not representative of the entire field. The
obvious solution was to see if computer scientists had the technological
tools available to automate the discovery of research datasets and the
associated research methods and fields in research publications. Our
computer science colleagues assured us that, while the technology
existed in principle, no single team was known for having developed a
solution.</p>
<p>We decided to see what we could to advance the field, and approached
Schmidt Sciences, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Overdeck Family
Foundation for support. As part of that support, we ran the competition
with the results described in this book. We challenged participants to
combine machine learning and natural language processing methods to
identify the datasets used in a corpus of social science publications
and infer both the scientific methods and fields used in the analysis
and the research fields.</p>
<p>The core of the book describes both how the competition was set up, as
well as the results achieved by different competing teams. However, as
is always the case with exciting research agendas, the competition
helped us identify five major scientific challenges that need to be
addressed: (i) document corpus development, (ii) ontology development
for dataset entity classification, (iii) natural language processing and
machine learning models for dataset entity extraction, (iv) graph models
for improving search and discovery, and (v) the use of the results to
engage the community to both validate the model results, retrain the
model and to contribute code and knowledge. So the other chapters in the
book provide an overview of what could be done with more resources and
talent devoted to this interesting question. The next section provides a
more detailed overview of the contribution of each chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="book-overview">
<h1>Book overview<a class="headerlink" href="#book-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Section 1 provides an overview of the motivation and approach. Section 2
describes new approaches to develop corpora and ontologies. Section 3
describes the competition results in terms of model development. Section
4 provides a forward looking agenda.</p>
<p>Section 1: Motivation and approach</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, “ Where’s Waldo: Conceptual issues when characterizing
data in empirical research,” researchers from the Research Data and
Service Center at the Deutsche Bundesbank show us why better metadata
for social science data enables discovery of datasets and research, in
ways that surpass what traditional metadata from data producers can
support. They present a new modus operandi in the service delivery model
of research data facilities, based on the premise that datasets have a
measurable value that can be deduced from the relationships between
datasets and publications, and the people who author, do research on,
and consume them - that is, Rich Context around datasets.</p>
<p>They argue that a major advantage of rich context is that it closes the
loop on metadata is closed: a loop initiated by the metadata from the
data producer side, is closed by metadata from the data usage side. The
authors elucidate why such rich data from the <em>usage</em> perspective is
needed to deliver codified knowledge to the research community to guide
literature review and new research; without understanding the linkage
between datasets and outcomes, we are disabled in shaping new, impactful
research.</p>
<p>The authors identify two primary reasons for this need: first, that
metadata on the datasets from the data users perspective helps the data
creator to improve upon the quality of the data itself, improving
dataset owners’ service delivery (e.g. bundesbank as a service provider,
the service being data provision, consulting on dataset usage, creation
of new data products, etc); and second, that metadata on the usage of
datasets in publications helps us measure impact of datasets in their
ability to drive policy-making. With this closed loop, the scope of
researchers’ discovery is broadened to include not only literature and
datasets, but the interplay between those two - that is, how datasets
have been used by whom and how.   The authors discuss a tangible outcome
of measuring dataset value - a dataset recommendation system, enabling
expedient sharing of available datasets through the research community.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 outlines the operational approach that was taken to develop
the <a class="reference external" href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition">Rich Context
Competition</a>.
The goal of the competition, the results of which are described in
Section 2, was to implement AI to automatically extract metadata from
research - identifying datasets in publications, authors and experts,
and methodologies used. As such, the competition was designed to engage
practitioners in AI and NLP to develop models based on a corpus
developed at the Interuniversity Consortium of Political and Social
Research. The competition attracted 20 teams from around the world and
resulted in four finalists presenting their results at NYU on February
15, 2019 (see the <a class="reference external" href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition/workshopagenda">agenda and video
here</a>).</p>
<p>The results of the competition provided metadata to describe links among
datasets used in social science research. In other words, the outcome of
the competition generated the basis for a moderately-sized knowledge
graph. the <a class="reference external" href="https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/an-interview-with-the-allen-institute-for-artificial-intelligence">winning
team</a>
in the Rich Context Competition was from <a class="reference external" href="https://allenai.org/">Allen
AI</a> which is a leader in the field of using
embedded models for natural language. Typical open source frameworks
which are popular for deep learning research include
<a class="reference external" href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> (from Facebook) and the more recent

</div>
<div class="section" id="section-2">
<h1>Section 2:<a class="headerlink" href="#section-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A major challenge is developing a training corpus that sufficiently
represents the population of all documents, and tagging the datasets in
the corpus. It is essential to do this well if high quality models are
to be developed. There is a literature outlining the issues with
developing a “gold standard corpus” (GSC) of language around data
being mentioned and used in analysis in academic publications, since
creating one is time-consuming and expensive (<em>12</em>) In Chapter 4
“Standardized Metadata, Full Text and Training/Evaluation for Extraction
Models”, Sebastian tk and Alex Wade describe the need for, and
strategies for collecting, large sets of annotated full-text sources for
use as training data for supervised learning models developed in the
Rich Context Competition. Dataset Extraction, the NLP task at the core
of the Rich Context Competition, relies on a high-quality set of full
text sources with metadata annotations. Developing such a corpus must be
done strategically, as full-text articles and their metadata are
organized inconsistently across their sources. The corpora gathered for
use as training data for the Competition required ad-hoc manual labor to
compile. Here, authors describe the legal, technological and human
considerations in creating a corpus. They dictate the scale of full-text
data needed, and the impact that an interdisciplinary (e.g spanning
multiple domains) corpus has on that scale. They suggest development of
a corpus with open-access text resources, use of human-annotators for
labeling of full-text, and attention to the mix of domains that may be
in a corpus when developing models.</p>
<p>There is a separate challenge of developing a common understanding of
what a dataset is. Developing standard ontologies is a fundamental
scientific problem, and one that is often in the domain of libraries and
information scientists. Although some measure of linguistic ambiguity is
likely to be unavoidable in the social sciences given the complex
subject matter, even modest ontologies that minimally control the
vocabulary researchers use would have important benefits. In Chapter 5,
“Metadata for Administrative and Social Science Data”, Robert B. Allen
describes a framework for the application of metadata to datasets,
details existing metadata schema, and gives an overview of the
technology, infrastructure and human elements that need to be considered
when designing a rich metadata schema for describing social science
data.</p>
<p>Allen describes three types of metadata - structural, administrative and
descriptive; and emphasizes the growth needed in descriptive metadata,
which are characterized by semantic descriptions. Allen describes
existing metadata schemas which accommodate domain-specific metadata
schema, like the W3C DCAT, and the unique semantic challenges faced by
social science as opposed to natural sciences - in particular that
concepts - e.g. “family”, “crime” -  are less well-defined, and
definitions change across sub-domains. He considers data repositories
and describes the essential role of metadata in making such repositories
searchable and therefore useful. He touches on several prominent data
repositories in the social and natural sciences and describes their
methods of gathering metadata and how the metadata supports services
offered, like search, computing environments, preservation of data for
archives, and logging of the history of a dataset and its provenance.
Allen describes other challengings in creating and maintaining metadata,
prompted by things like changes in technology that yield data streams,
and changes in metadata standards. He discusses some of the technology
underlying data repositories; in particular data cubes for data storage
that facilitate data exploration and retrieval; containerization and
cloud computing enabling sharing and reproducibility; and collection
management systems which can provide metrics on usage, like number of
downloads, maintenance of datasets, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section-3">
<h1>Section 3:<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Chapter 6, by the Allen AI team, describes their overarching approach.
The team used a named entity recognition model to predict dataset
mentions. For each mention, they generated a list of candidate datasets
from the knowledge base. They also developed a rule based extraction
system which searches for dataset mentions seen in the training set,
adding the corresponding dataset IDs in the training set annotations as
candidates. They then use a binary classiﬁer to</p>
<p>predict which of these candidates is a correct dataset extraction. While
this approach was eventually the winning approach given the design of
the corpus and the scoring mechanism, it suffers from being too fragile
for general application, since it is necessarily corpus dependent. That
team did not devote substantial time to identifying fields and methods.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, by the KAIST team, describes a very different approach. They
generated their own questions about dataset names and use a machine
learning technique to train the model for solving question answering
task. In other words, questions suitable for finding dataset names such
as “What is the dataset used in this paper?,” are generated and the
question answering model is trained to find the answers to those
questions from the papers. Furthermore, the resulting answers from the
model are filtered by types of each word. For example, if an answer
contains words with organization or agency types, then this answer is
likely to include the actual dataset names. They also were quite
innovative with identifying research fields, by using Wikipedia as the
source, and methods by using machine learning techiques</p>
<p>Chapter 8, by the GESIS team, also used a Named Entity Recognition
procedure. However, their design was module-based approach and they
developed tools that can be used separately but also as parts of a data
processing pipeline. For identifying research methods and fields, they
exploited the Social Science Open Access Repository maintained at GESIS
– Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. They also used the ACL
Anthology Reference Corpus which is a corpus of scholarly publications
about computational linguistics</p>
<p>Chapter 9, by the DICE team at Paderborn University, also used a Named
Entity Recognition approach. They trained an Entity Extraction model
based on Conditional Random Fields and combined it with the results from
a Simple Dataset Mention Search to detect datasets in an article. For
the identification of Fields and Methods, they essentially used search
string to find embedded words</p>
<p>Chapter 10, by Singapore Management University, was an incomplete
submission, with a very interesting approach. They used dataset
detection followed by implicit entity linking approach to tackle dataset
extraction task. They adopt weakly supervised classification for
research methods and fields identification tasks utilizing SAGE
Knowledge as an external source and as a proxy for weak labels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section-4-looking-forward">
<h1>Section 4: Looking forward<a class="headerlink" href="#section-4-looking-forward" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In Chapter 11, researchers from Digital Science describe the role user
engagement plays in creating rich context around datasets, which are
take on properties of ‘first class research objects’ (like journal
articles) in that they are published as distinct research outputs in
their own right.  Authors lay out a set of challenges in the sharing of
datasets and dissemination of dataset metadata, and articulate goals in
creating infrastructure to answer these challenges.</p>
<p>As technology has yielded ever larger streams of datasets available for
social science research, two critical, interrelated elements of
infrastructure have not kept apace: information infrastructure, and
cultural infrastructure.  Information infrastructure refers to content
of interest to the rich context competition models - journal articles,
datasets, and their metadata (including details on the data stewards,
usage of the datasets in research, and code used to prepare and analyze
datasets). Cultural infrastructure refers to the incentives and value
propositions in place to encourage individual data stewards, data users
and experts to share datasets and contribute metadata on datasets.
Cultural infrastructure around datasets do not fit into the existent
culture of research publications.</p>
<p>In venturing to build out information infrastructure around datasets, we
must consider how concepts like versioning, reproducibility, and peer
review carry over to datasets. Further, how do metadata carry over, when
there is so much variability in what we mean when we say dataset?
Incentives around data sharing, dataset curation, and metadata
contribution are even slimmer than in publishing, where there exists a
culture of “publish or perish.” This question must be resolved if we
wish to enrich the context around datasets to make them more efficiently
consumable.</p>
<p>The future agenda is described in the concluding chapter by Paco Nathan
and Ian Mulvany</p>
<p>The first step is to create a corpus of research publications to be used
for training data during the Rich Context Competition.</p>
<p>The next step will be a formal implementation of the knowledge graph,
based primarily on extensions of open standards and use of open source
software. That graph is represented as an extension of a DCAT-compliant
data catalog. Immediate goals are to augment search and discovery in
social science research, plus additional use cases that help improve the
knowledge graph and augment research.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the process introduces human-in-the-loop AI into
data curation, ultimately to reward researchers and data stewards whose
work contributes additional information into the system. With this
latter step, in the broader sense Rich Context helps establish a
community focused on contributing code plus knowledge into the research
process</p>

<p>General competition information</p>
<p>The competition had two phases. In the first phase, participants were
provided with labeled data, consisting of a corpus of 2,500 publications
matched to the datasets cited within them. Participants could use this
data to train and tune their algorithms. In the second phase, they were
provided with a large corpus of unlabeled documents and asked to
identify the datasets used in the documents in a test corpus, as well as
the associated methods and research fields. The participants were scored
on the accuracy of their techniques, the quality of their documentation
and code, and the efficiency of the algorithm – and also on their
ability to find methods and research fields in the associated passage
retrieval.</p>
